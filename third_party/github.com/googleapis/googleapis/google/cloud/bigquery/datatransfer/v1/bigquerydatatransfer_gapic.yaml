  # The name_pattern is a pattern to describe the names of the resources of this
  # collection, using the platform's conventions for URI patterns. A generator
  # may use this to generate methods to compose and decompose such names. The
  # pattern should use named placeholders as in `shelves/{shelf}/books/{book}`;
  # those will be taken as hints for the parameter names of the generated
  # methods. If empty, no name methods are generated.
  # The entity_name is the name to be used as a basis for generated methods and
  # classes.
