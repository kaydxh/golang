1.3.35 (February 23, 2020)
==========================

Special Issues:

* It has been discovered that the 'ICU' library (a perhaps 30MB C++
  library) which is now often a libxml2 dependendency causes huge
  process initialization overhead.  This is noticed as unexpected
  slowness when GraphicsMagick utilities are used to process small to
  medium sized files.  The time to initialize the 'ICU' library is
  often longer than the time that GraphicsMagick would otherwise
  require to read the input file, process the image, and write the
  output file.  If the 'ICU' dependency can not be avoided, then make
  sure to use the modules build so there is only impact for file
  formats which require libxml2.  Please lobby the 'ICU' library
  developers to change their implementation to avoid long start-up
  times due to merely linking with the library.

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 398 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz (some of which were
  benign build issues) and 11 issues remain open.
  The issues list is available at
  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
  "graphicsmagick".  Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days.  There are too many
  fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.

Bug fixes:

* Fix broken definition of ResourceInfinity which resulted in that
  GetMagickResource() would return -1 rather than the maximum range
  value for the return type as documented. (problem added by the
  1.3.32 release).

* ModifyCache(): Re-open the pixel cache if the cache rows/columns do
  not match the owning image rows/columns.

* Fix DisplayImages() return status.  The return status was inverted.

* HISTOGRAM: Histogram once again includes the histogram as a text
  comment.  This became broken by previous security fixes.

* PICT: Fixed heap buffer overuns reported multiple sources.

* JNG: Detect when JPEG encoder has failed and throw an exception.

* MVG/DrawImage(): Performs even more parsing validations.

* Clang static analyzer fixes: A great many fixes were made based on
  problem reports by the Clang static analyzer.

* Visual Studio static analyzer fixes: A great many fixes were made
  based on problem reports by the Visual Studio 2019 static analyzer.
  Many of these may improve the robustness of 64-bit code.

New Features:

* GRADIENT/GradientImage(): Improved accuracy of gradient levels as
  well as dramaticaly improving performance.  Output PseudoClass
  images if we can.  Add support for using the image 'gravity'
  attribute as well as the "gradient:direction" definition to produce
  gradient vector directions corresponding to SouthGravity (the
  previously-existing default), NorthGravity, WestGravity,
  EastGravity, NorthWestGravity, NorthEastGravity, SouthWestGravity,
  and SouthEastGravity.

API Updates:

* InitializeMagickEx(): New function which may be used in place of
  InitializeMagick() to initialize GraphicsMagick.  This
  initialization function returns an error status value, may update a
  passed ExceptionInfo structure with error information, and provides
  an options parameter which supports simple bit-flags to tailor
  initialization.  The signal handler registrations are skipped if the
  MAGICK_OPT_NO_SIGNAL_HANDER flag is set in the options.

Feature improvements:

* Replace use of non-reentrant legacy POSIX functions with reentrant
  equivalents.

* Timing of image reads should now be very accurate.  The timer was
  sometimes not stopped as soon as it should be.

* PICT: The PICT reader is working pretty good now.  It handles all
  the PICT image files I have available to me.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* Visual Studio Build: Configure program now provides a checkbox to
  enable common optimizations for better performance.

Behavior Changes:

* POSIX Signals: Use the normal termination signal handler for SIGXCPU
  and SIGXFSZ so that ulimit or setrlimit(2) may be used to apply CPU
  (RLIMIT_CPU) and output file size (RLIMIT_FSIZE) limits with the
  normal cleanup, and without dumping core. Note that any output files
  currently being written may be truncated and files being written by
  external programs (e.g. Ghostscript) might be left behind unless
  they are to a temporary file assigned by GraphicsMagick.

* Some private string and integer constants were removed from the
  apparent library ABI.  Some private functions were marked static and
  removed from the apparent library ABI.  This is mentioned because
  someone is sure to notice and be concerned about it.

* The remaining private content in installed header files was moved
  into -private.h header files which are not installed.  This should
  not be cause for concern but is mentiond because someone is sure to
  notice and be concerned about it.


1.3.34 (December 24, 2019)
==========================

Special Issues:

* It has been discovered that the 'ICU' library (a perhaps 30MB C++
  library) which is now often a libxml2 dependendency causes huge
  process initialization overhead.  This is noticed as unexpected
  slowness when GraphicsMagick utilities are used to process small to
  medium sized files.  The time to initialize the 'ICU' library is

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 386 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz (some of which were
  benign build issues) and 376 of those issues have been resolved.
  The issues list is available at
  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
  "graphicsmagick".  Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days.  There are too many
  fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.

Bug fixes:

* DPS: Eliminate a memory leak.

* Debug Trace: Only output text to terminate an XML format log file if
  XML format is active.

* EXIF Parser: Detect non-terminal parsing and report an error.

* EXIF Parser: Eliminate heap buffer overflows.

* HuffmanDecodeImage(): Fix heap overflow in 32-bit applications.

* MAT: Implement subimage/subrange support.

* MVG: Address non-terminal loops, excessive run-time, thrown
  assertions, divide-by-zero, heap overflow, and memory leaks.

* OpenModule(): Now properly case-insensitive, as it used to be.

* PCX: Verify that pixel region is not negative. Assure that opacity
  channel is initialized to opaqueOpacity.  Update DirectClass
  representation while PseudoClass representation is updated.  Improve
  read performance with uncompressed PCX.

* PICT: Fix heap overflow in PICT writer.

* PNG: Fix validation of raw profile length.

* PNG: Skip coalescing layers if there is only one layer.

* PNM: Fix denial of service opportunity by limiting the length of PNM
  comment text.

* WPG: Avoid Avoid dereferencing a null pointer.

* WPG: Implement subimage/subrange support.

* WPG: Improve performance when reading an embedded image.

* Wand library: In MagickClearException(), destroy any existing
  exception info before re-initializing the exception info or else
  there will be a memory leak.

* XPM: Rquire that image properties appear in the first 512 bytes of
  the XPM file header.

New Features:

* Visual Studio build supports JBIG and WebP compression in TIFF format.

API Updates:

* None

Feature improvements:

* Compliles clean using GCC 9.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* bzlib: bzip is updated to 1.0.8 release.

* jbig: jbigkit is updated to 2.1 release.

* lcms: lcms2 is updated to 2.9 release.

* libxml: libxml2 is updated to 2.9.10 release.

* png: libpng is updated to 1.6.37 release.

* tiff: libtiff is updated to 4.1.0 release.

* webp: libwebp is updated to the 1.0.3 release.

* zlib: zlib is updated to 1.2.11 release.

* TIFF: Now also supports reading JBIG-compressed TIFF, and
  reading/writing WebP-compressed TIFF.  A number of libtiff feature
  options which are now commonly enabled were disabled and are now
  enabled by default.

Build Changes:

* MinGW: Static and shared library builds were not working.  Only the
  modules build was actually working!

* Python scripts related to the build (enabled by
  --enable-maintainer-mode) are now compatible with Python 3.

* Now supports using Google gperftools tcmalloc library for the memory
  allocator.  This improves performance for certain repetitive
  work-loads and heavily-threaded algorithms.

* Configure now reports the status of zstd (FaceBook Zstandard)
  compression in its configuration summary.

* TclMagick: Address many issues mentioned by SourceForge issue #420
  "TclMagick issues and patch".

Behavior Changes:

* PNG: Post-processing to convert the image type in the PNG reader
  based on a specified magick prefix string is now disabled.  This can
  (and should) be done after the image has been returned.

* Trace Logging: The compiled-in logging default is always to stderr,
  which may be over-ridden using log.mgk as soon as it is loaded.

* Windows Build: Search registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER as well as
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE when searching for Ghostscript.  By following the
  procedure documented in SourceForge bug 615 "GhostScript
  installation check", this allows for local user installations
  without "administrator" privileges.

1.3.33 (July 20, 2019)
==========================

Special Issues:

* It has been discovered that the 'ICU' library (a perhaps 30MB C++
  library) which is now often a libxml2 dependendency causes huge
  process initialization overhead.  This is noticed as unexpected
  slowness when GraphicsMagick utilities are used to process small to

  change their implementation to avoid long start-up times due to
  merely linking with the library.

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 353 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 338 of those
  issues have been resolved.  The issues list is available at
  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
  "graphicsmagick".  Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days.  There are too many
  fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.

* Documentation has been added regarding security hazards due to
  commands which support a '@filename' syntax.

* MontageImages(): Fix wrong length argument to strlcat() when
  building montage directory, which could allow heap overwrite.

Bug fixes:

* PNG: Pass correct size value to strlcat() in module registration
  code.  This bug is noticed to cause problems for Apple's OS X and
  Linux Alpine with musl libc.  This fixes a regression introduced by
  the 1.3.32 release.

* Re-implement command-line utility `'@'` file inclusion support for
  `-comment`, `-draw`, `-format`, and `-label` which was removed for
  the 1.3.32 release.  The new implementation is isolated to
  command-line utility implementation code rather than being deeply
  embedded in the library and exposed in other usage contexts.  This
  fixes a regression introduced by the 1.3.32 release.

* CAPTION: The The CAPTION reader did not appear to work at all any
  more.  Now it works again, but still not very well.

* MagickXDisplayImage(): Fix heap overwrite of windows->image.name and
  windows->image.icon_name buffers.  This bug has surely existed since
  early GraphicsMagick releases.

* MagickXAnimateImages(): Fix memory leak of scene_info.pixels.

* AcquireTemporaryFileDescriptor(): Fix compilation under Cygwin. This
  fixes a regression introduced by the 1.3.32 release.

* PNG: Fix saving to palette when mage has an alpha channel but no
  color is marked as transparent.

* Compilation warnings in the Visual Studio WIN64 build due to the
  'long' type being only 32-bits have been addressed.

New Features:

* None

API Updates:

* None

Feature improvements:

* None

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* None

Behavior Changes:

* Support for `'@'` file inclusion support for `-comment`, `-draw`,
  `-format`, and `-label` has been restored.

1.3.32 (June 15, 2019)
==========================

Special Issues:

* It has been discovered that the 'ICU' library (a perhaps 30MB C++
  library) which is now often a libxml2 dependendency causes huge
  process initialization overhead.  This is noticed as unexpected
  slowness when GraphicsMagick utilities are used to process small to
  medium sized files.  The time to initialize is often longer than the

  change their implementation to avoid long start-up times due to
  merely linking with the library.

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 343 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 331 of those
  issues have been resolved.  The issues list is available at
  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
  "graphicsmagick".  Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days.  There are too many
  fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.

* BMP reader: Fix heap overflow in 32-bit build due to arithmetic
  overflow. Only happens if limits are changed from defaults.

* BMP reader/writer: Improve buffer-size calculations to guard against
  buffer overflows.

* DIB reader: Reject files which claim more than 8-bits per pixel but
  also claim to be colormapped.

* DIB reader/writer: Improve buffer-size calculations to guard against
  buffer overflows.

* MIFF reader: Detect end of file while reading RLE packets.

* MIFF reader: Fix heap overflow (for some files using RLE
  compression) caused by a typo in the code.

* MAT writer: Added missing error handling to avoid heap overflow.

* MNG reader: Fixed a small heap buffer overflow.

* SVG reader: Fixed a stack buffer overflow.

* TGA writer: Fix heap overflow when image rows/columns are larger
  than 65535.

* TIFF reader: Rationalize tile width/height to reject large tile
  sizes which are much larger than the image dimensions.

* TIFF reader: Apply memory resource limits to strip and tile allocations.

* WMF reader: Fixed a division by zero problem.

* XWD reader: Many heap buffer overflows and uses of uninitialized data were fixed.

* Pixel cache: Now apply resource limits to pixel nexus allocations
  using the same limits (total pixels, width, height, memory) as
  applied to the whole image since some requests are directly
  influenced by the input file.  More tests are added for arithmetic
  overflow.  Care was taken to minimize performance impact due to the
  many extra checks.

Bug fixes:

* See above note about oss-fuzz fixes.

* Fixed include order of magick/api.h vs wand/wand_symbols.h.

* WriteImage(): Eliminate use of just-freed memory in
  clone_info->magick when throwing exception due to no support for
  format.

* Magick++/lib/Magick++/Drawable.h: Fix use of clang diagnostic syntax.

* DIB: Preserve PseudoClass opaque representation if ICO mask is opaque.

* JPEG reader: Restore ability to access detailed image properties
  while in 'ping' mode.

* JPEG reader: Base test for "Unreasonable dimensions" on original
  JPEG dimensions and not the scaled dimensions.

* JPEG reader: Allow input files to have a compression ratio as high
  as 2500.  Extremely compressed files were being rejected.

* FreeType renderer: Fixed a memory leak.

* PDF writer: Fixed a memory leak.

* PDF writer: Fixed a thread safety problem.

* PICT reader: Fix a thread safety problem.

* Exception reporting: Throwing an exception was not thread safe.  Now it is.

* Exception reporting: Handle the case where some passed character
  strings refer to existing exception character strings.

* Command-line parser now does not attempt to read a list of filenames
  from a file in '@name' syntax if the path '@name' exists.
  Previously it would attempt to read a list of file names from 'name'
  even if '@name' did exist.

* Rendering: Short-circuit path parsing and return and error
  immediately if an error occurs.

New Features:

* Added support for writing the Braille image format (by Samuel
  Thibault).

* WebP writer: Support WebP 'use_sharp_yuv' option ("if needed, use
  sharp (and slow) RGB->YUV conversion") via `-define
  webp:use-sharp-yuv=true`.

* The version command output now reports the OpenMP specification
  number rather than just the integer version identifier.

API Updates:

* ReallocateImageColormap() added to re-allocate an existing colormap.

* Some improperly-exposed globals are now static as they should have
  been.

Feature improvements:

* Microsoft Windows timing information now uses
  QueryPerformanceFrequency() and QueryPerformanceCounter() for
  increased precision.

* The 'benchmark' command now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of elapsed
  time indication.

* The 'time' command now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of elapsed time
  indication.

* The logging facility now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of time
  resolulution

* Dcraw: When QuantumDepth is greater than 8, pass -6 option to dcraw
  so that it returns a 16-bit/sample image.

* Dcraw: If Dcraw supports TIFF format, then request TIFF format in
  order to be able to acquire more metatdata.

* Scale algorithm: Eliminate artifacts when scaling an image with
  semi-transparent pixels.

* Library metrics: The number of shared library relocations and the
  amount of initialized data has been signficantly reduced by
  following recommendations from Ulrich Drepper's document `How To
  Write Shared Libraries <https://akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf>`_.

  For comparison, these are the differences in library metrics between
  the 1.3.31 and 1.3.32 releases for a simple shared library with all
  features supported:

  +---------+-------------+------------------+------------+
  | Release | Relocations | Initialized Data | Total Size |
  +=========+=============+==================+============+
  | 1.3.31  |      12,432 |          506,496 |  3,587,227 |
  +---------+-------------+------------------+------------+
  | 1.3.32  |         747 |          127,936 |  3,033,279 |
  +---------+-------------+------------------+------------+

  and these are the differences in library metrics between 1.3.31 and
  1.3.32 for a shared library using the modules option (recommended!)
  with all features supported:

  +---------+-------------+------------------+------------+
  | Release | Relocations | Initialized Data | Total Size |
  +=========+=============+==================+============+
  | 1.3.31  |       5,370 |          176,784 |  1,940,620 |
  +---------+-------------+------------------+------------+
  | 1.3.32  |         367 |          119,472 |  1,825,651 |
  +---------+-------------+------------------+------------+

  As can be seen, the number of relocations was extreme and has been
  reduced to reasonable levels while also diminishing the amount of
  initialized data and the total size of the library/program.  Most of
  the remaining initialized data (106,648 bytes) and some of the
  relocations (65 relocations) may be attributed to the optional X11
  animate/display/import support.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* The test suite now passes even if no fonts are found.

* Configure script does better at finding Windows fonts on non-Windows systems.

* The configure script now supports the option --with-mtmalloc to
  enable use of the mtmalloc library as found on Solaris-derived
  systems.

Behavior Changes:

* AnnotateImage(): No longer implicitly call TranslateText() since
  this is not suitable for most use-cases and causes additional
  performance impact.  The API user can perform such translations in
  advance on the text string using TranslateText() if need be.


1.3.31 (November 17, 2018)
==========================

Special Issues:

* Firmware and operating system updates to address the Spectre
  vulnerability (and possibly to some extent the Meltdown
  vulnerability) have substantially penalized GraphicsMagick's OpenMP
  performance.  Performance is reduced even with GCC 7 and 8's
  improved optimizers. There does not appear to be anything we can do
  about this.

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 292 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 279 of those
  issues have been resolved.  The issues list is available at
  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
  "graphicsmagick".  Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days.  There are too many
  fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.

Bug fixes:

* See above note about oss-fuzz fixes.

* CINEON: Fix unexpected hang on a crafted Cineon image.  SourceForge
  issue 571.

* Drawing recursion is limited to 100 and may be tuned via the
  MAX_DRAWIMAGE_RECURSION pre-processor definition.

* Fix reading MIFF files using legacy keyword 'color-profile' for ICC
  color profile as was used by ImageMagick 4.2.9.

* Fix reading/writing files when 'magick' is specified in lower case.
  This bug was a regression in 1.3.30.


New Features:

* TIFF: Support Zstd compression in TIFF.  This requires libtiff
  4.0.10 or later.

* TIFF: Support WebP compression in TIFF.  This requires libtiff
  4.0.10 or later.

API Updates:

* MagickMonitor() is marked as deprecated.  Code should not be using
  this function any more.

Feature improvements:

* The progress monitor callbacks (registered using MagickMonitor() or
  MagickMonitorFormatted()) are serialized via a common semaphore
  rather than via critical sections in OpenMP loops.  OpenMP loops are
  updated to use OpenMP 'atomic' and 'flush' to update shared loop
  variables rather than using a OpenMP 'critical' construct, reducing
  contention.  Performance on some targets is observed to have been
  improved by this change.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* There was already a 'compare' command installed with the
  '--enable-magick-compat' configure option was used but it did not
  function.  Now it functions.  There was no `compare` command in
  ImageMagick 5.5.2 and this compare command is only roughly similar
  to a `compare` command in some subsequent ImageMagick release.

* Removed Remove Ghostscript library support (--with-gslib) from
  configure script.  The 'HasGS' pre-processor defines which were
  enabled by this remain in the source code so it is still possible to
  use this library if absolutely necessary (e.g. CPPFLAGS=-DHasGS
  LIBS=-lgs).

* No longer explicitly link with the OpenMP library when it will be
  supplied already due to CFLAGS.

Behavior Changes:

* JPEG: Libjpeg-turbo is allowed 1/5th the memory resource limit
  provided for Graphicsmagick via the cinfo->mem->max_memory_to_use
  option, which is part of the IJG JPEG API/ABI, but usually not
  supported there.  This feature works for libjpeg-turbo 1.5.2 and
  later.  Limiting the memory usage is useful since libjpeg-turbo may
  otherwise consume arbitrary amounts of memory even before
  Graphicsmagick is informed of the image dimensions.

* JPEG: The maximum number of JPEG progressive scans is limited to 50.
  Otherwise some technically valid files could be read for almost
  forever.


1.3.30 (June 23, 2018)
=========================

Special Issues:

* None

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 238 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 230 of those
  issues have been resolved.  The issues list is available at
  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
  "graphicsmagick".  Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days.  There are too many
  fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.

* SVG/Rendering: Fix heap write overflow of PrimitiveInfo and
  PointInfo arrays.  This is another manefestation of CVE-2016-2317,
  which should finally be fixed correctly due to active
  detection/correction of pending overflow rather than using
  estimation.

Bug fixes:

* Many oss-fuzz fixes are bug fixes.

* Drawing/Rendering: Many more fixes by Gregory J Wolfe (see the ChangeLog).

* MIFF: Detect end of file while reading image directory.

* SVG: Many more fixes by Gregory J Wolfe (see the ChangeLog).

* The AlphaCompositePixel macro was producing wrong results when the
  output alpha value was not 100% opaque. This is a regression
  introduced in 1.3.29.

* TILE: Fix problem with tiling JPEG images because the size request
  used by the TILE algorithm was also causing re-scaling in the JPEG
  reader.  The problem is solved by stripping the size request before
  reading the image.

New Features:

* None

API Updates:

* The size of PrimitiveInfo (believed to be an internal/private
  structure but in a header which is installed, has been increased to
  store a 'flags' argument. This is intended to be an internal
  interface but but may be detected as an ABI change.

Feature improvements:

* None

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* The oss-fuzz build script (fuzzing/oss-fuzz-build.sh) now includes
  many delegate libraries such as zlib, libpng, libtiff, libjpeg, and
  freetype, resulting in more comprehensive testing.  The Q16 build is
  now being tested rather than the 'configure' default of Q8.

Behavior Changes:

* JPEG: The JPEG reader now allows 3 warnings of any particular type
  before giving up on reading and throwing an exception.  This choice
  was made after observing files which produce hundreds of warnings
  and consume massive amounts of memory before reading the image data
  has even started.  It is currently unknown how many files which were
  previously accepted will be rejected by default.  The number of
  allowed warnings may be adjusted using '-define
  jpeg:max-warnings=<value>'.  The default limit will be adjusted
  based on reported user experiences and may be adjusted prior to
  compilation via the MaxWarningCount definition in coders/jpeg.c.


1.3.29 (April 29, 2018)
=========================

Special Issues:

* None

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 180 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 173 of those
  issues have been resolved.  The issues list is available at
  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
  "graphicsmagick".  Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days.  There are too many
  fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.

* JNG: Require that the embedded JPEG image have the same dimensions
  as the JNG image as provided by JHDR. Avoids a heap write overflow.

* MNG: Arbitrarily limit the number of loops which may be requested by
  the MNG LOOP chunk to 512 loops, and provide the '-define
  mng:maximum-loops=value' option in case the user wants to change the
  limit.  This fixes a denial of service caused by large LOOP
  specifications.

Bug fixes:

* Many oss-fuzz fixes are bug fixes.

* DICOM: Pre/post rescale functions are temporarily disabled (until
  the implementation is fixed).

* JPEG: Fix regression in last release in which reading some JPEG
  files produces the error "Improper call to JPEG library in state
  201".

* ICON: Some DIB-based Windows ICON files were reported as corrupt to
  an unexpectedly missing opacity mask image.

* In-memory Blob I/O: Don't implicitly increase the allocation size
  due to seek offsets.

* MNG: Detect and handle failure to allocate global PLTE. Fix divide
  by zero.

* DrawGetStrokeDashArray(): Check for failure to allocate memory.

* BlobToImage(): Now produces useful exception reports to cover the
  cases where 'magick' was not set and the file format could not be
  deduced from its header.

New Features:

* None

API Updates:

* Wand API: Added MagickIsPaletteImage(), MagickIsOpaqueImage(),
  MagickIsMonochromeImage(), MagickIsGrayImage(), MagickHasColormap()
  based on contributions by Troy Patteson.

* New structure ImageExtra added and Image 'clip_mask' member is
  replaced by 'extra' which points to private ImageExtra allocation.
  The ImageGetClipMask() function now provides access to the clip mask
  image.

* New structure DrawInfoExtra and DrawInfo 'clip_path' is replaced by
  'extra' which points to private DrawInfoExtra allocation.  The
  DrawInfoGetClipPath() function now provides access to the clip path.

* New core library functions: GetImageCompositeMask(),
  CompositeMaskImage(), CompositePathImage(), SetImageCompositeMask(),
  ImageGetClipMask(), ImageGetCompositeMask(), DrawInfoGetClipPath(),
  DrawInfoGetCompositePath()

* Deprecated core library functions: RegisterStaticModules(),
  UnregisterStaticModules().

Feature improvements:

* Static modules (in static library or shared library without
  dynamically loadable modules) are now lazy-loaded using the same
  external interface as the lazy-loader for dynamic modules.  This
  results in more similarity between the builds and reduces the fixed
  initialization overhead by only initializing the modules which are
  used.

* SVG: The quality of SVG support has been significantly improved due
  to the efforts of Greg Wolfe.

* FreeType/TTF rendering: Rendering fixes for opacity.

1.3.28 (January 20, 2018)
=========================

Special Issues:

* None

Security Fixes:

* BMP: Fix non-terminal loop due to unexpected bit-field mask value
  (DOS opportunity).

* PALM: Fix heap buffer underflow in builds with QuantumDepth=8.

* SetNexus() Fix heap overwrite under certain conditions due to using
  a wrong destination buffer.  This issue impacts all 1.3.X releases.

* TIFF: Fix heap buffer read overflow in LocaleNCompare() when parsing
  NEWS profile.

Bug fixes:

* DescribeImage(): Eliminate possible use of null pointer.

* GIF: Fix memory leak of global colormap in error path.

* GZ: Writing to gzip files with the extension ".gz" was not working
  with Zlib 1.2.8.

* JNG: Fix buffer read overflow (a tiny fixed overflow of just one byte).

* JPEG: Promoting certain libjpeg warnings to errors caused much more
  problems than expected.  The promotion of warnings to errors is
  removed.  Claimed pixel dimensions are validated by file size before
  allocating memory for the pixels.

* IntegralRotateImage(): Assure that reported error in rotate by 270
  case does immediately terminate processing.

* MNG: Fix possible null pointer reference related to DEFI chunk
  parsing.  Fix minor heap read overflow (constrained to just one
  byte) due to an ordering issue in a limit check.  Fix memory leaks
  in error path.

* WebP: Fix stack buffer overflow in WriteWEBPImage() which occurs
  with libwebp 0.5.0 or newer due to a structure type change in the
  structure passed to the progress monitor callback.

* WPG: Memory leaks fixed.

New Features:

* None

API Updates:

* InterpolateViewColor(): This function now returns MagickPassFail (an
  unsigned int) rather than void so that errors can be efficiently
  reported.

* The magick/pixel_cache.h header is updated to add deprecation
  attributes such that code using GetPixels(), GetIndexes(), and
  GetOnePixel() will produce deprecation warnings for compilers which
  support them.  These functions will not be removed in the 1.3.X
  release series and when they are removed, pre-processor macros will
  be added so a replacement function is used instead.  There is a
  long-term objective to eliminate functionally-redundant pixel cache
  functions to only the ones with the best properties since this
  reduces maintenance and may reduce the depth of the call stack
  (improving performance).

Feature improvements:

* None

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* PerlMagick: Sanitize PACKAGE_VERSION so that Perl is not confused by
  any trailing alpha character.

* Improved symbol renaming due to adding --enable-symbol-prefix.  Some
  symbols (for static const strings) were not being included in the
  renaming.


Behavior Changes:

* None

1.3.27 (December 9, 2017)
=========================

Special Issues:

* None

Security Fixes:

* CMYK: Fix heap overwrites in raw CMYK writer.  Fix heap overwrites
  in raw CMYK reader (noticed when doing montage).

* GIF: Assure that global colormap is initialized.

  opportunity).

* DrawDashPolygon(): Fix heap out of bounds read in render code.

* GRAY: Fix heap overwrites in raw GRAY reader (noticed when doing
  montage).

* JNG: Fix heap overruns.  Fix assertions.

* JNG: Prevent a crash due to zero-length color_image while reading a
  JNG image. (CVE-2017-11102).  Reject JNG files with unreasonable
  dimensions given the file size (avoid DOS).

* JNX: Fix DOS due to excessive memory allocations with corrupt file.

* JPEG: Do not allocate backing image pixels until a scanline has been
  successfully read.  Avoids DOS opportunity with suitably
  manufactured file.

* MAP: Fix null pointer dereference or segmentation violation.

* MAT: Fix heap write overflow.

* MNG: Reject over-large (65k by 65k) image.  Fix heap overwrites.

* SUN: Fix heap read overflow.  Fix DOS due to excessive memory
  allocations with corrupt file.

* SVG: Fix heap write overflow.

* TIFF: Use heuristics to avoid DOS (excessive memory use) due to
  false claims by input file.  It is possible that this may reject
  some valid files.  Fix possible small heap overwrite beyond the
  allocated scanline buffer due to the NumberOfObjectsInArray() macro
  rounding up rather than down.

* UIL: Fix heap overwrite in writer.

* WPG: Fix DOS issues (memory, disk space, CPU time) due to
  insufficient validations.  Fix heap overwrites.

* XBM: Fix DOS issue where code remains stuck in loop and does not
  return.

* XV 332 (PNM): Fix null pointer dereference due to malformed file.

* TracePSClippingPath()/TraceSVGClippingPath(): Fix heap out of bounds
  read.

* Validate path entries in the MAGICK_CODER_MODULE_PATH and
  MAGICK_FILTER_MODULE_PATH environment variables and convert all
  paths to real paths if possible. This avoids possible use of
  relative paths to load modules (a possible security issue), or the
  possibility of adding a directory which was in the path, but
  missing, and may improve efficiency by removing non-existent paths.

Bug fixes:

* AVS: Memory leaks eliminated.

* CMYK: Memory leaks eliminated.

* CUT: Memory leaks eliminated.  Fix possible use of NULL pointer.

* DCM: Fix possible use of NULL pointer.

* TIM: Fix memory leak.

* TOPOL: Fix possible use of NULL pointer.  Fix memory leaks.

* VIFF: Fix memory leak.

* WEBP: Detect partial write to output file.

* WPG: Fix possible use of null pointer. Fix excessive use of disk
  resources due to insufficient validations.

* WriteImage(): Restore use of GetBlobStatus() to test if an I/O error
  was encountered while writing output file. This assures that I/O
  failure in writers which do not themselves verify writes is assured
  to be reported.

* WMF: Memory use after free issues eliminated.

* YUV: Fix memory leaks.


New Features:

* PNG: Implemented eXIf chunk support.

* WEBP: Add support for EXIF and ICC metadata provided that at least
  libwebp 0.5.0 is used.

  image so it looks right-side up by default.

Feature improvements:

* None

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* Libtiff is updated to libtiff 4.0.9.

Build Changes:

* JPEG/PNG: The SETJMP_IS_THREAD_SAFE definition is used to determine
  if setjmp/longjmp are thread safe.  If these interfaces are thread
  safe, then concurrent reads/writes are possible.  This definition is
  false for Solaris but true for Linux.  JPEG and PNG will be fully
  concurrent if this definition is enabled.

Behavior Changes:

* PALM: PALM writer is disabled.

* ThrowLoggedException(): Capture the first exception at
  ErrorException level or greater, or only capture exception if it is
  more severe than an already reported exception.

* DestroyJNG(): This internal function is now declared static and is
  removed from shared library or DLL namespace.


1.3.26 (July 4, 2017)
=====================

Special Issues:

* None

Security Fixes:

* DPX: Fix excessive use of memory (DOS issue) due to file header
  claiming large image dimensions but insufficient backing
  data. (CVE-2017-10799).

* JNG: Fix memory leak when reading invalid JNG image (CVE-2017-8350).

* MAT: Fix excessive use of memory (DOS issue) due to continuing
  processing with insufficient data and claimed large image
  size. Verify each file extent to make sure that it is within range
  of file size. (CVE-2017-10800).

* META: Fix heap overflow while parsing 8BIM chunk (CVE-2016-7800).

* PCX: Fix denial of service issue.

* RLE: Fix abnomally slow operation (denial of service issue) with
  intentionally corrupt colormapped file.

* PICT: Fix possible buffer overflow vulnerability given suitably
  truncated input file.

* PNG: Enforce spec requirement that the dimensions of the JPEG
  embedded in a JDAT chunk must match the JHDR dimensions
  (CVE-2016-9830).

* PNG: Avoid NULL dereference when MAGN chunk processing fails.

* SCT: Fix stack-buffer read overflow (underflow?) while reading SCT
  header.

* SGI: Fix denial of service issues.  Delay large memory allocations
  until file header has fully passed sanity checks.

* TIFF: Fix out of bounds read when reading CMYKA TIFF which claims to
  have only 2 samples per pixel (CVE-2017-6335).

* TIFF: Fix out of bounds read when reading RGB TIFF which claims to
  have only 1 sample per pixel (CVE-2017-10794).

* WPG: Fix heap overflow (CVE-2016-7996).  Fix assertion crash
  (CVE-2016-7997).

Bug fixes:

* DifferenceImage(): Fix Fix all-black difference image if an input
  file is colormapped.

* EXIF orientation was not being properly detected for some files.

* -frame: The `import` command -frame handling was improperly
  implemented and was using already freed data.

* GIF: Fixes for "Excessive LZW string data" problem.

* Magick++: Bug fixes to PathSmoothCurvetoRel::operator() and
  PathSmoothCurvetoRel::operator().

* PAM: Support writing GRAYSCALE PAM format.

* PNG: Fix memory leaks.

* SVG: Fixed a memory leak.  Fixed a possible null pointer dereference.

* TclMagick: Problem that TkMagick could not resolve functions from
  TclMagick under Linux is fixed.

* TclMagick: Fix parser validatation in magickCmd() to avoid crash
  given a syntax error.

* TIFF: Fix for reading old JPEG files (avoids "Improper call to JPEG
  library in state 0. (LibJpeg).").

* TXT: Fixed memory leak.

* XCF: Error checking is improved.

New Features:

* EXIF rotation: Support is added such that the EXIF orientation tag
  is updated when the image is rotated.

* MAT: Now support reading multiple images from Matlab V4 format.

* Magick++: Orientation method now updates orientation in EXIF
  profile, if it exists.

* Magick++: Added Image attribute method which accepts a character
  pointer argument, and will remove the attribute if the value
  argument is NULL.

* -orient: The -orient command line option now also updates the
  orientation in the EXIF profile, if it exists.

* PGX: Support PGX JPEG 2000 format for reading and writing (within
  the bounds of what JasPer supports).

* Wand API: Added MagickAutoOrientImage(),
  MagickGetImageOrientation(), MagickSetImageOrientation(),
  MagickRemoveImageOption(), and MagickClearException().


Feature improvements:

* None

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* TIFF: Updated to libtiff 4.0.8.

Build Changes:

* TclMagick: Updated configure to use latest TEA tcl.m4 version 3.10.
  Support for AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS so that 'make distcheck'
  remembers configuration options, and also to uninstall pkgIndex.tcl.

* VisualMagick Configure: A 'quantum' command line argument is added
  to set the default quantum depth in the wizard drop-down list.  This
  This allows setting the quantum depth when the /nowizard argument
  was supplied.

Behavior Changes:

* The installer for the Windows build no longer includes IMDisplay
  (simple display program), ImageMagickDLL, and PerlMagick for
  ActiveState Perl.  These are still available to build from the
  source tree.  All of these depend on proprietary components.

1.3.25 (September 5, 2016)
==========================

Special Issues:

* None

Security Fixes:

* EscapeParenthesis(): I was notified by Gustavo Grieco of a heap
  overflow in EscapeParenthesis() used in the text annotation code.
  While not being able to reproduce the issue, the implementation of
  this function is completely redone.  This issue was assigned
  CVE-2016-7447 after the release.

* Utah RLE: Reject truncated/absurd files which caused huge memory
  allocations and/or consumed huge CPU.  Problem was reported by
  Agostino Sarubbo based on testing with AFL.  This issue was assigned
  CVE-2016-7448 after the release.

* SVG/MVG: Fix another case of CVE-2016-2317 (heap buffer overflow) in
  the MVG rendering code (also impacts SVG).  This issue (remaining
  part) was assigned CVE-2016-7446 after the release.

* TIFF: Fix heap buffer read overflow while copying sized TIFF
  attributes.  Problem was reported by Agostino Sarubbo based on
  testing with AFL.  This issue was assigned CVE-2016-7449 after the
  release.

Bug fixes:

* GetToken(): Fix obscure bug (read beyond end of string buffer)
  noticed while parsing a MVG file.  This problem was reported by
  Gustavo Grieco.

* MVG rendering: Fix undesired hard errors when some objects were
  drawn outside of the image bounds.  Requests to draw objects
  entirely outside of the image should be silently ignored.

* MVG/SVG rendering: Fix gradient size sanity checks which were
  causing gradient requests to fail.  Due to a design weakness in that
  gradient images allocate resources rather than being computations at
  point of use, the maximum gradient image size is now hard-limited to
  5000x5000 pixels until the design problem is fixed.  Some SVG icons
  (as small as 8x8 pixels) authored using Inkscape request absurdly
  huge gradients.  Gradient sizes as large as 20,000x20,000 have been
  observed in SVG icon files delivered by packages on an Ubuntu Linux
  system.

* SVG: Fix some memory leaks which occur on parsing error.

New Features:

* None

Feature improvements:

* ElapsedTime(): Use clock_gettime() (when available with default
  linkage) to obtain elapsed time.

* DescribeImage(): Provide 6 digits of seconds precision in in elapsed
  time output.  Previously the resolution was rounded up to a full
  second.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* webp: Updated bundled libwebp to release 0.5.1.

* libxml: Updated bundled libxml2 to release 2.9.4.

* lcms: Updated bundled lcms2 to release 2.8.

* png: Update bundled libpng to release 1.6.24.

Build Changes:

* OpenMP is properly configured for clang 3.8 using its own '-lomp'
  rather than '-lgomp'.

Behavior Changes:

* SVG: Some SVG files may be rejected due to absurdly large gradient
  requests.

* The 'identify' and 'info' functionality only shows the pixel read
  rate if image was not read in 'ping' mode. Provide 6 digits of
  seconds precision in in elapsed time output.

1.3.24 (May 30, 2016)
==========================

.. _`GCC bug 53967` : http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53967

Special Issues:

* A shell exploit (CVE-2016-5118) was discovered associated with a
  filename syntax where file names starting with '|' are intepreted as
  shell commands executed via popen().  Insufficient sanitization in
  the SVG and MVG renderers allows such filenames to be passed through
  from potentially untrusted files.  There might be other ways for
  untrusted inputs to produce such filenames.  Due to this issue,
  support for the feature is removed entirely.

* A shell exploit was discovered associated with the gnuplot delegate
  and which is triggered by the 'gplt' entry in delegates.mgk.  A
  remote exploit is possible if the attacker can cause a provided SVG
  or MVG file to be rendered (or the user opens a provided file).  The
  gnuplot program must be installed in order for the exploit to be
  successful.  It is strongly recommended to remove this entry in all
  delegates.mgk files.

* Due to `GCC bug 53967`_, several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
  may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
  enabled for floating point math (`-mfpmath=sse`) if the GCC option
  `-frename-registers` is used. Default 32-bit builds do not
  experience the problem since they use '387 math.  It is not clear in
  what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed by
  the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe.  Other compilers do not
  suffer from this bug.  Please lobby the GCC project to fix this
  embarrassing performance bug.

Security Fixes:

* BLOB: Remove support for reading input from a shell command, or
  writing output to a shell command, by prefixing the specified
  filename (containing the command) with a '|'.  This feature provided
  a remote shell execution opportunity.

* DIB: Fixed out of bounds reads.  Added more header validations.

* JNG: File size limits are enforced.

* MAT: Fixed denial of service opportunity.  Fix hang on corrupt deflate stream.

* META: Fixed out of bounds reads and writes.

* MIFF: Fixed thrown assertion.

* MSL: Ignore the file extension on MSL files.  It is necessary to add
  a "msl:" prefix to MSL files to read the as an image.

* MVG: No longer assume that files ending with extension ".mvg" are
  MVG files.  MVG parsing does more validity checking on its input.
  Assure that enough PrimitiveInfo structures are allocated in advance
  to support a given vector path (heap overflow problem).

* PCX: Fixed unreasonable memory allocation due to intentionally
  corrupt file.

* PDB: Fixed a heap buffer overflow and out of bounds read.

* PICT: Fixed an out of bounds write.

* PS: Ghostscript is now always run with -dSAFER for safer execution.

* PSD: Fixed segmentation violations, heap buffer overflows, and out
  of bounds writes.

* RLE: Fixed out of bounds reads and writes.

* ReadImages(): Fixed a possible infinite recursion due to a crafted input file.

* RotateImage(): Fixed thrown assertion.

* SGI: Fixed out of bounds writes.

* SUN: Fixed out of bounds reads and writes.

* SVG: Fixed heap and stack buffer overflows, as well as segmentation
  violations (CVE-2016-2317 and CVE-2016-2318).  Also fixed endless
  loop, unexpectedly large memory allocation, divide by zero, and
  recursion issues.

* TIFF: Fixed an assertion while reading.  Fixed benign heap overflow.

* TMP: Adding a "tmp:" prefix to a filename no longer removes the file
  since this seems dangerous.

* VIFF: Fix excessive memory allocation with intentionally corrupted input file.

* XCF: Fixed a heap buffer overflow.

* XPM: Fixed several heap buffer overflows, and out of bound
  reads/writes.  Also fixed a case of excessive memory allocation.

* delegate.mgk: The default delegate.mgk file has been pared down in
  order to reduce security exposure.

* gnuplot ('gplt' delegate in delegates.mgk): Support for rendering
  gnuplot files is removed since the format is inherently insecure.

* File names: File names starting with a '|' character are no longer
  interpreted as shell commands to be executed as input or output.


Bug fixes:

* BMP: Fix reading 24-bit Microsoft BMP which claims to have a
  colormap.

* FILE: `file://` URLs are properly supported now (they never worked
  before).

* JP2: It is now possible to write lossless JPEG 2000 "JP2" format.

* SVG: Support font-size "medium".

New Features:

* Blob I/O C APIs: Added signed versions of short and long Read/Write
  functions.

* FILE: `file://` URLs are properly supported now (they never worked
  before).

* MAT: Matlab V4 is now partially supported.

* Magick++: Added double-precision xResolution() and yResolution()
  methods to support setting the horizontal and vertical resolution
  with double floating point precision.

* Mogrify now supports a -preserve-timestamp option to preserve file
  access and modification timestamps.

Feature improvements:

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* Updated bundled libpng to release 1.6.19.

* Updated bundled libwebp to release 0.4.4.

* Update bundled libxml2 to release 2.9.3.

* Update bundled freetype to release 2.6.2.

Build Changes:

* Added ``--enable-broken-coders`` configure option to enable file
  format support which may be broken or cause security issues.  The
  PSD format is now classified as "broken" (until it is fixed).

Behavior Changes:

* PSD format is not included in the build by default.

* Files ending with ".mvg" and ".msl" are not assumed to be image
  files by default.

* File names starting with '|' are no longer treated as shell
  commands.

* Gnuplot and POV delegate support is removed from the default
  delegate.mgk file.

1.3.23 (November 7, 2015)
==========================

Special Issues:

* Due to `GCC bug 53967`_, several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
  may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
  enabled for floating point math (`-mfpmath=sse`) if the GCC option
  `-frename-registers` is used. Default 32-bit builds do not
  experience the problem since they use '387 math.  It is not clear in
  what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed by
  the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe.  Other compilers do not
  suffer from this bug.  Please lobby the GCC project to fix this
  embarrassing performance bug.


Security Fixes:

* ScaleImage(): While not strictly a security issue, requesting to
  scale an image while retaining the original number of rows will lead
  to a program crash or memory corruption due to double-free.

Bug fixes:

* ScaleImage(): Fix problem with new width/height match original
  (regression added by 1.3.22).

* ScaleImage(): Fix double-free when new rows matches original rows
  (regression added by 1.3.22).

* MinGW build fix related to eliminating a sleep() macro which
  conflicts with a MinGW-provided inline sleep() function.

* PNG: Issue a warning instead of an error when attempting to read a
  PNG file containing a zero-length profile.  This allows the file to
  be read.

* identify: Fix problem in that `identify -format "%A"` (to test if
  transparency is supported in image) does not always produce the
  correct results.

New Features:

* None.

Feature improvements:

* None.

Performance Improvements:

* None.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None.

Build Changes:

* Configure: Removed CFLAGS and LDFLAGS deduplication code which
  caused problems for user-provided CFLAGS and LDFLAGS which added and
  then removed compiler/linker options.  Specifically, this fixes a
  problem with creating OS X universal builds.

* Configure: Add tests for 'ps2write' and 'eps2write' which are
  available in recent Ghostscript.

Behavior Changes:

* None


1.3.22 (October 4, 2015)
==========================

.. _`GCC bug 53967` : http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53967


Thanks:

* Coverity: We thank Coverity for providing free service for free
  software projects, and thank Jodie Cunningham for getting the
  project set up in Coverity.

Special Issues:

* Due to `GCC bug 53967`_, several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
  may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
  enabled for floating point math (`-mfpmath=sse`) if the GCC option
  `-frename-registers` is used. Default 32-bit builds do not
  experience the problem since they use '387 math.  It is not clear in
  what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed by
  the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe.  Other compilers do not
  suffer from this bug.  Please lobby the GCC project to fix this
  embarrassing performance bug.

* Magick++: Any libraries or applications using Magick++ should be
  rebuilt in order to use this new release.  Libraries and
  applications will be able to continue to use prior versions of
  Magick++ without being re-built, while benefiting from updated C
  libraries, provided that the system supports library versioning.

Security Fixes:

* General Coverity fixes.  Some might have security consequences.

* Ghostscript options concatenation is more secure against buffer
  overflow.

* Windows: Built-in random number generator is now salted using
  CryptGenRandom().  This improves the robustness of the temporary
  file allocator.

Bug fixes:

* Coverity Fixes: Large amounts of fixes due to Coverity static

  used to save and restore the associated channel using the same raw
  format as "GRAY".

* Magick++: Image::repage() method added to support resetting 'page'.

* PDF: Added '-define pdf:stop-on-error=true' optoin to cause PDF
  reading to quit immediately upon any error.

.. _`Valgrind` : http://www.valgrind.org/

.. _`American fuzzy lop` : http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/

Thanks:

  * Gynvael Coldwind and Mateusz Jurczyk of the Google Security Team
    provided test files which allowed us to find and fix security
    problems in the software.

  * Hanno Bck provided test files which allowed us to find and fix
    security problems in the software.

  * Tobias Ospelt provided test files and advice which allowed us to
    find and fix security problems in the software.

  * Michal Zalewski provided test files which allowed us to find and
    fix security problems in the software.

  * Jodie Cunningham did lots of fuzzing to find issues and set up the
    project on Coverity for automatic analysis.

  * `American fuzzy lop`_ was used to produce and discover many of the
    files which caused problems for the software.

  * `AddressSanitizer`_ (ASan) was used to detect and isolate memory
    access issues.

  * `Valgrind`_ was used to detect and isolate memory access issues as
    well as memory leaks

Special Issues:

  * Due to `GCC bug 53967`_, several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
    may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
    enabled for floating point math (`-mfpmath=sse`) if the GCC option
    `-frename-registers` is used. Default 32-bit builds do not
    experience the problem since they use '387 math.  It is not clear
    in what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed
    by the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe.  Other compilers do
    not suffer from this bug.  Please lobby the GCC project to fix
    this embarrassing performance bug.

  * Magick++: Any libraries or applications using Magick++ should be
    rebuilt in order to use this new release.  Libraries and
    applications will be able to continue to use prior versions of
    Magick++ without being re-built, while benefiting from updated C
    libraries, provided that the system supports library versioning.

Security Fixes:

  * Annotate: Some requestable text-substitution attributes caused a
    crash.

  * All formats: Image dimensions are checked to assure that they are
    within limits before proceeding to read the image.

  * BMP: Fix hang (endless loop) for certain files.

  * DCM: Fix crash as well as small heap over-write.

  * DPX: Fix crash due to DPX file reporting more elements than it
    has.

  * MNG: Validate MHDR chunk length to avoid huge memory allocation
    and DOS.

  * PCX: Fix for CVE-2014-8355. Validate file header in order to avoid
    buffer overun later.

  * PDB: Detect arithmetic overflows when calculating buffer sizes.
    Fix crash in writer when image width is not even multiple of 16.
    Fix buffer overrun with 2 and 4-bit PDB image files.

  * PNM: Validate PGM, PPM, and PAM header MaxValue parameter to avoid
    crash on poorly-formed input.

  * PNG: Impose a 10-million limit on dimensions when reading a PNG
    file to avoid denial of service.

  * PSD: Avoid problems caused by huge PSD colormap size.

  * PSD: Fix small stack over-write if more than 99 layers are written
    to PSD format.

  * PSD: Returns immediately if pixel limit was exceeded.

  * RLE: URT RLE reader is now more robust with errant files.

  * SUN: Header validation is now made fully robust, and arithmetic
    overflows in buffer-size calculations are detected to avoid heap
    overwrite.

  * TIFF: Fix crashes for photometrics which may deliver one or three
    samples per pixel (was assuming always three).

  * VIFF: Fixes to prevent buffer overflow.  Validate colormap indexes.

  * Windows delegates: Fix unexpected argument splitting when invoking
    an external delegate program via delegates.mgk.

  * WPG: Fix use of NULL pointers.  Fix buffer overflows.

  * XPM: Detect truncated row and quit with error rather than
    over-running a buffer.

  * XWD: Improve header validation.  Added to UnstableCoderClass since
    the reader for this format should not be entrusted with
    untrustworthy input.

Bug fixes:

  * CIN: Fix problem with text attribute values which are not NULL
    terminated.  Validate sizes claimed by Cineon header.

  * Coverity: Fixes for many issues detected by Coverity scan (see
    ChangeLog).

  * DPX: Fix problem with text attribute values which are not NULL
    terminated.

  * DPX: Fix severe corruption of little-endian 32-bit packed output.
    Corruption was severe enough that it would have been noticed
    immediately.

  * Delegates: Fix possible memory leaks when invoking external
    application.

  * FITS: Properly validate values provided by file header.

  * GIF: Fix use of uninitialized data.

  * JBIG: Fix memory leaks.

  * JNG: Fix double-free error in error path.

  * JPEG: Verify the number of output components before attempting to
    decode the image.

  * Magick++: Image resolutionUnits() was not always returning correct
    value.

  * Magick++: Locking has not been working properly since the code was
    written in 1998.  Apparently the issue has not been significant
    enough to cause run-time issues.

  * ICO: Windows icon reader is now much more robust.

  * MIFF: Reader now quits with an error if zip or bzip2 stream is
    corrupted.

  * MAT: Fix memory leaks.

  * PALM: Reader now reads various input formats (up to version 2)
    correctly whereas it was crashing or otherwise malfunctioning
    before.  More work remains, particularly in the writer.

  * PCX: Eliminate memory leaks in error paths.

  * PDB: In PDB writer, void possible under-allocation due to
    arthimetic overflow when allocating packets.

  * PICT: Fix PICT reader crash with corrupted file.

  * PNG: Fix double-free error in error path.

  * PNG: Fixed handling of transparency when writing indexed PNG.

  * PNG: Avoid reading beyond the end of a tEXt keyword.

  * PSD: Fix error when reading PSDs files which have no layers.

  * RLA: Fix possible crash due to file header.

  * Signal Handling: Signal handling is now more robust and handles
    SIGSEGV and other critical signals.  The sole purpose of the
    default signal handling is to remove any temporary files and quit.
    An informative message is printed for signals other than SIGINT.

  * SUN: Sun raster reader was not completely robust. Now it is.

  * SWF: Fix pixel cache access errors in 'ping' mode.

  * Text annotation: An empty text string is no longer treated as an
    error.

  * Text annotation: Fix regression added in 1.3.19 which caused
    spurious drawing errors to be produced while rendering with text
    when all of the text is off the left-hand side of the image.

  * TIFF: Fix unreliable reading JBIG compressed files by forcing use
    of strip reader rather than sometimes using scanline reader (which
    libtiff's JBIG codec does not support).

  * TIFF: Fix reading or writing planar min-is-white or min-is-black
    images with an associated alpha channel.

  * WebP: WebP writer now writes truely lossless output when
    requested.

  * identify / GetImageStatistics(): Failed to compute statistics for
    the Black channel of CMYK image files.

  * VICAR: Fix problem with continuing to "read" data when there is no
    more data left to read.

  * WMF: Fix memory leaks.

  * WPG: Fix potential DOS due to long reads during an error
    condition.

  * XPM: Avoid strncpy() of overlapping memory.  Fixed memory leaks in
    error paths.  Fixed bad memory access caused by empty file.

New Features:

  * compose: Supports composite operator names similar to the major
    \*Magick brand, without losing any compatibility with previous
    naming.

  * ICO: Windows ICO reader now supports reading PNG-encoded files.

  * Magick++ Geometry: New methods limitPixels() and fillArea() to
    support '@' and '^' geometry qualifiers.  This enhancement breaks
    the ABI due to previous use of inline methods and no place to put
    the new flags.

  * Magick++ Image::extent(): New method to place image on sized
    canvas of constant color using gravity.

  * Magick++ Image::formatExpression(): New method format a string
    based on a format similar to command-line -format.

  * Magick++ Image::resize(): New method to resize image specifying
    geometry, filter, and blur.

  * Magick++ STL extentImage: New function object to invoke image
    extent method.

  * Magick++ Image::quiet().  New method which blocks (ignores)
    warning exceptions when passed a 'true' argument.

  * Resource limits: Added support for image Width and Height limits.
    Default image Width and Height limits are based on the range of a
    32-bit signed integer, even for 64-bit builds which may have
    sufficient numeric range to image an entire galaxy.  Limits may be
    increased as desired.

  * TIFF: Use define tiff:ignore-tags to ignore tags in 'corrupted'
    files with unknown and invalid tags.  Use to read TIFF files which
    otherwise can not be read due to errors.

  * TIFF: Use '-define tiff:report-warnings=true' to enable that
    warnings reported by libtiff are thrown as warning exceptions so
    that they may be caught or will be reported at the gm
    command-line.

  * Windows Exceptions: A handler is registered (due to calling
    InitializeMagick()) to capture Windows Exceptions in a similar
    manner to the existing POSIX signal handler.  If an application is
    using the library and wants to provide its own Windows exception
    handling, then it should make any changes after invoking
    InitializeMagick().

Feature improvements:

  * None.

Performance Improvements:

  * None.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

  * PNG: Update bundled libpng to 1.6.16.  Resolves known security
    issues.

  * FreeType: Update bundled Freetype to 2.5.4.  Resolves known
    security issues.

  * WebP: Update bundled WebP to 0.4.2 release.

  * WebP is auto-linked in Visual Studio.

Build Changes:

  * WebP is not included in the build when building with Visual Studio
    6 (1998 vintage compiler!) since it requires more modern C.

Behavior Changes:

  * AVI: Support for this format is removed since the implementation
    was worthless.

  * TIFF: Now uses YCbCr encoding when JPEG compression is requested
    for an RGB image.


1.3.20 (August 16, 2014)
=========================

Special Issues:

  * Due to `GCC bug 53967`_, several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
    may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
    enabled for floating point math (`-mfpmath=sse`) if the GCC option
    `-frename-registers` is used. Default 32-bit builds do not
    experience the problem since they use '387 math.  It is not clear
    in what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed
    by the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe.  Other compilers do
    not suffer from this bug.  Please lobby the GCC project to fix
    this embarrassing performance bug.

Security Fixes:

  * No security issues were reported or fixed.

Bug fixes:

  * Compilation: No longer undefine __attribute__ since this may be
    used by system or compiler headers and cause problems.

  * BMP: Alpha channel from BMP3 format was inverted.

  * PNG: Fix round-trip repeatability issue (due to rounding
    algorithm) with modern versions of libpng.  Prefer the less
    accurate method which does not alter the image.

  * PNG: Fix some memory leaks in error-handling paths.

  * PNM: Scaling of alpha in sub-ranged pixels is fixed.

  * Wand API: Removed development debug fprintf which causes each
    drawing primitive to be printed to stderr.

  * PS, PS2, PS3, PDF: Only use resolution from image or -density if
    units were properly specified.  Without units, resolution is
    worthless.

  * PS, PS2, PS3, PDF: Use resolution from image if it appears to be
    valid.

  * WebP: Fix inverted return status which caused failure to be
    reported instead of success.

  * Rotation clipping/shearing errors for short wide images at some
    angles are fixed.

  * -geometry: Deal with resize geometry missing width or height
    (e.g. '640x' or 'x480') by substituting the missing value with one
    which preserves the image aspect ratio.  This has been documented
    to be supported since almost the dawn of GraphicsMagick but was
    not actually supported until now.

  * -geometry: Support '>' and '<' qualifiers with '@' qualifier to
    specify if image should be resized if larger or lesser than given
    area specification.

New Features:

  * Wand API: MagickSetImageGravity() - New function to set image
    gravity.

  * Wand API: MagickGetImageGravity() - New function to get image
    gravity.

  * Wand API: MagickSetImageMatte() - New function to set the image
    matte channel enable flag.

  * Wand API: MagickGetImageMatte() - New function to read the image
    matte channel enable flag.

  * Wand API: MagickSetImageGeometry() - New function to set the image
    geometry string.

  * Wand API: MagickGetImageGeometry() - New function to get the image
    geometry string.

  * Wand API: MagickOperatorImageChannel() - New function to apply an
    operator to an image channel.

  * Magick++ API: New Image::thumbnail() method for fast image
    resizing, particularly to make thumbnails.

  * Core C API: Added SetLogMethod() to allow an application/library
    to specify a function to be called for logging.

  * Clang/LLVM: Provide support for clang/llvm attribute and builtin
    specifiers similar to that provided for GCC.

  * OpenMP: OpenMP native locking and thread specific data is
    supported via a configuration option (is not the default).  This
    offers a "pure" OpenMP compilation mode.  No real value for this
    compilation mode has been observed yet but it seems worthy to
    support.

  * Coders: Added BrokenCoderClass to mark coders which often
    malfunction or are not very useful in their current condition.

  * Composition: Added HardLight composition operator, which is now
    used by PSD and XCF formats, and available via command line,
    Magick++ API, PerlMagick API, and Wand API.

  * Composition: Added ScreenCompositePixels composition operator.

  * Composition: Added missing Photoshop separable compositing
    operations, Overlay, Exclusion, ColorBurn, ColorDodge, SoftLight,
    LinearBurn, LinearDodge, LinearLight, VividLight, PinLight,
    HardMix.

  * +set: Command line utilities now support +set to remove an
    existing image attribute.

  * -format: Support additional format specifiers 'g', 'A', 'C', 'D',
    'G', 'H', 'M', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'T', 'U', 'W', 'X', and '@', similar
    to the major brand.

  * -operator: New quantum operators ThresholdBlackNegateQuantumOp and
    ThresholdWhiteNegateQuantumOp. These correspond to -operator
    "Threshold-Black-Negate" and "Threshold-White-Negate".

  * TIFF: Now support setting the TIFF "Software" tag for users who do
    not want to admit to using GraphicsMagick.

  * WebP: All of the WebP encoder encoder options are now supported
    by -define arguments.


Feature improvements:

  * Pixel interpolation quality is greatly improved, with minimal
    impact on performance.  Pixel interpolation now also works well
    given an alpha channel.

  * WebP: WebP support is now prepared to compile with most WebP
    library versions and supports all features except for those
    pertaining to "RIFF" container support.

Performance Improvements:

  * Non-integral image rotation performance has been improved by about
    40%, with lower memory usage as well.

  * GradientImage: Update image is_grayscale and is_monochrome flags
    based on gradient color properties.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

  * PNG: Libpng 1.6.12 - June 12, 2014.

  * JPEG: libjpeg 9a of January 19, 2014.

  * FreeType: FreeType 2.5.3 of March 6, 2014.

  * WebP: webp 0.4.0 of January 20, 2013.

  * zlib: zlib 1.2.8 of April 28, 2013.

Build Changes:

  * --without-threads no longer disables use of OpenMP.  Use the
    already existing option --disable-openmp to disable OpenMP.

  * Makefiles: Include paths are now exceedingly pedantic to make sure
    that only the required directories are included.

  * VisualMagick configure: Improve configure program so that it is
    possible to select QuantumDepth, OpenMP, and 64-bit build via
    configure dialog boxes as well as options on the command line.
    Also automatically detects and deals with similarly named files in
    subdirectories so that WebP support can now build successfully.

Behavior Changes:

  * MultiplyCompositePixels: Multiply composition now uses SVG
    interpretation of how alpha should be handled.  No longer does a
    simple multiply of alpha channel.

  * Composition: The Difference, Darken, Lighten, and HardLight
    composition operators were modified to support alpha in their
    computations.

  * PNG: Using -optimize no longer triggers palette and depth
    optimizations since their implementations have been problematic.


1.3.19 (December 31, 2013)
==========================

Special Issues:

  * Due to `GCC bug 53967`_, several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
    may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
    enabled for floating point math (`-mfpmath=sse`) if the GCC option
    `-frename-registers` is used. Default 32-bit builds do not
    experience the problem since they use '387 math.  It is not clear
    in what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed
    by the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe.  Other compilers do
    not suffer from this bug.

Security Fixes:

  * EPT: Fix crash observed when Ghostscript fails to produce useful
    output.  This was particularly noticeable when Ghostscript was not
    installed.  This crash could be used to cause denial of service.

  * PNG: With libpng 1.6.X, avoid a crash while copying a PNG with a
    "known incorrect ICC profile".  This crash could be used to cause
    denial of service.

Bug fixes:

  * Build: Fix cross-compilation for MinGW64 on Linux build machine.

  * Build: configure FreeType test no longer insists that
    <freetype/freetype.h> can be included.

  * CMS profile: Only delete the CMS transform if it is non-null.
    Fixed assertion observed when lcms returned a null profile and
    GraphicsMagick attempted to deallocate it.

  * Drawing: Improve error handling logic so that drawing returns
    quickly on pixel access errors rather than plowing on ahead.  This
    avoids problems with SVGs which take seemingly forever to render.

  * Drawing via C/C++ APIs: `BevelJoin` no longer causes a MVG parsing
    error.

  * EPT: Fix crash observed when Ghostscript fails to produce useful
    output.  This was particularly noticeable when Ghostscript was not
    installed.

  * OpenMP: Revert use of omp_set_dynamic() since it caused
    performance issues when using GCC's GOMP implementation and the
    number of threads to use is specified.

  * EXIF profile: Support the `SubjectArea` EXIF tag.

  * MIFF writer: PseudoClass format was written incorrectly for depth
    greater than 8.

  * MIFF writer: RLE compressed format used inverted alpha from the
    other subformats contrary to the MIFF specification.

  * MIFF reader: Fixes to be able to read MIFF written by
    ImageMagick 6.X, including DirectClass grayscale images (except
    for RLE compressed).

  * Mosaic: Fixed unsigned underflow problem with -mosaic when page
    offset is negative and exceeds image width or height, resulting in
    assertions, out of memory errors, or pixel cache limit errors.

  * PDF: Consistently initialize Image page width and height to image
    width and height.  While general to all of GraphicsMagick, this
    change is to assure that the PDF writer computes page dimensioning
    consistently.  PDF page dimensioning was wrong if the image had
    been resized with -geometry "100%".

  * PAM: Fix MAXVAL scaling when reading PAM images.  PAM was only
    working correctly for images with 256 or 64k levels.

  * PNM: PGM "P2" format writer wrote bad output for 8-bit depth.

  * PNG: With libpng 1.6.X, avoid a crash while copying a PNG with a
    "known incorrect ICC profile".

  * PNG: Q8 GM build now correctly reads 16-bit PNG files.

  * TIFF writer: Try to avoid writing more than 32k strips per image
    by increasing rows-per-strip since some programs fail to read
    images with more than 32k strips per image.

  * TIM reader: PSX TIM reports 8-bit depth (rather than 16).

  * TTF font rendering: Improve FreeType rendering error logic so that
    rendering returns immediately on pixel access errors rather than
    plowing on ahead.

  * TTF font rendering: Support rendering UTF-8 up to 21-bit code
    points.  Was only supporting 16-bit code points.

  * Wand API: DrawSetStrokeDashArray() / DrawGetStrokeDashArray(), fix
    failure to work properly due to this code path never being tested.

  * Windows Ghostscript: 64-bit GraphicsMagick no longer requires both
    32-bit and 64-bit builds of Ghostscript to be installed in order
    to read Postscript and PDF formats.

  * XPM reader: Reported depth now depends on the colormap rather than
    always claiming to be 16-bit.

New Features:

  * JPEG: Add support for writing 'XMP' profile.

  * PNM: As a simple non-standard extension to the standard PNM and
    PAM formats, support writing and reading 32-bit sample depth.
    Writing such files is only supported by the Q32 build although
    they may be read by any build.

  * WebP: Now supports reading and writing Google's WebP format.  This
    feature is not currently supported by the Windows Visual Studio
    build.

Feature improvements:

  * Pixel composition based on BlendCompositePixel() is enhanced to
    completely eliminate under-color from the blending if the
    under-pixel is fully transparent.  Also blends based on the
    average opacity of both pixels rather than only the over-pixel.
    This change did not result in any change in the GM test suite
    results but it is possible that there could be some negative
    impact from it.  Please report any issues noticed which are due to
    this change.

  * X11 `display`: For DirectClass image, use ThumbnailImage() rather
    than SampleImage() when creating the panner icon to improve the
    quality of the image.

Performance Improvements:

  * PNG: `ping` a PNG faster by avoiding reading the image data.

Windows Delegate Updates:

  * Updated IJG JPEG library to release 9.

  * Updated PNG library to release 1.6.8.

  * Updated lcms2 library to release 2.5.

  * Updated libxml2 library to release 2.9.1.

  * Updated FreeType library to release 2.5.2.

Behavior Changes:

  * MIFF: Now writes PseudoClass images correctly when depth is
    greater than 8.  This impacts the reader, which will not be able
    to read previously written incorrect format correctly.  Images
    like this should be very rare.  The solution is to use an older
    GraphicsMagick version to convert such images to a valid storage
    format (with a depth of 8) so that they may be read with this
    version.

  * MIFF: Now writes RLE-compressed RGBA images with correct
    alpha. This impacts the reader, which will not be able to read
    previously written incorrect format correctly. Images like this
    should be very rare. A solution is to use an older GraphicsMagick
    version to use a compression algorithm other than RLE so that they
    are read correctly with this version.  Another solution is to
    process problematic images with '-operator Opacity Negate 0' to
    invert the alpha channel.

  * TIFF: Returns DirectClass images by default for MINISWHITE and
    MINISBLACK TIFF formats (rather then colormapped).

  * Windows: Also search c:\gs\fonts for Ghostscript font files.  This
    search path is normally hard-coded into Ghostscript binaries and
    is a convenient place to put fonts so they may be shared by
    multiple Ghostscript versions.

  * XPM: Now limits color resolution to 16-bits, even with Q32 build.


1.3.18 (March 10, 2013)
==========================

Special Issues:

  * Due to `GCC bug 53967`_, several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
    may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
    enabled for floating point math (`-mfpmath=sse`) if the GCC option
    `-frename-registers` is used. Default 32-bit builds do not

    in what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed
    by the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe.  Other compilers do
    not suffer from this bug.

Security Fixes:

  * None.

Bug fixes:

  * Fixed bug with format substitutions if input string ends with a
    single '%'.

  * BMP: Fixed an old bug with decoding chromaticity primaries.

  * PNG: Fixed reading of interlaced images.  Fix reading of sub-8-bit
    palette and grayscale images.  Some PNG sub-formats were written
    incorrectly.  Fix crash in PNG8 writer if image colors happened to
    be non-zero but image was not actually colormapped.

  * PNG: Configure script now also searches for libpng versions 16 and
    17.

  * TIFF: Fix a crash which was noticed when writing RGBA separated
    (planar) format.

  * `--enable-symbol-prefix` was not prefixing all of the C
    symbols. Some core C library functions were not prefixed.  This
    option applies to the Wand library API as well now.

  * C API: When input is from a user-provided file descriptor, the
    file position is restored after reading the file header bytes.
    Previously the file position was rewound to the beginning of the
    file.  This allows reading embedded image data from the current
    offset in a file, and allows continuing to use the stream after
    GraphicsMagick has returned the image.

  * C API: It is now possible to invoke CloseBlob() multiple times.

  * display: Display was supposed to respond to +/-usePixmap, but was
    not. It was responding to +/-use_pixmap.  Now it responds to both.

  * Windows/VisualMagick: Fix building GraphicsMagick with Intel ICC
    compiler driven by Visual Studio Professional 2012.

  * Windows: Avoid a crash and produce a useful diagnostic if
    Ghostscript is needed but not yet installed.


New Features:

  * GM utility: New 'batch' command was contributed by Kenneth Xu
    which supports executing any number of other GM utility
    sub-commands in a single invocation in a sort of "batch" script.
    Input may be piped from standard input, from a specified file, or
    from a 'GM >' command prompt.  This utilities front-end allows any
    other program/script to drive 'gm' using a co-process model and
    speeds up execution by eliminating utility start-up/shut-down
    time.

  * WIN64 (64-bit Windows): Windows 64-bit is now officially supported.

  * convert/mogrify: Now support -auto-orient to automatically rotate
    the image upright for viewing based on its current orientation
    setting.  Also support -orient to support setting the current
    image orientation.  Please note that the orientation property of
    EXIF profiles is not yet updated so the EXIF profile will be wrong
    after using -auto-orient.

  * C API: AutoOrientImage(), new function to automatically orient
    the image so that it is upright for normal viewing.

  * Wand API: MagickGetImagePage()/MagickSetImagePage(), new functions
    to support getting and setting the image page size and offsets.

  * PNG: Added PNG48 and PNG64 support. Added PNG00 support (png
    encoder that inherits its color-type and bit-depth from the input,
    if the input was a PNG datastream).

Feature improvements:

  * GraphicsMagick TAP tests may now be run stand-alone using Perl's
    'prove' TAP test driver.

Performance Improvements:

  * Detection of glob specifications in file names is more efficient.

Windows Delegate Updates:

  * None.

Behavior Changes:

  * ltdl: Libltdl is no longer bundled.  Libltdl must be previously
    installed on the system in order to build the modules
    configuration.

  * AppendImages() now converts subsequent images to the colorspace of
    the first image, and no longer converts the first image to RGB.
    Instead, it is assumed the user knows what she/he is doing.

  * SetImageColorRegion() no longer automatically converts the image
    to RGB.  The user is responsible for assuring that the provided
    color is in the same colorspace as the image.


1.3.17 (October 13, 2012)
==========================

Security Fixes:

  * PNG: Fix for CVE-2012-3438. The Magick_png_malloc function in
    coders/png.c in GraphicsMagick 6.7.8-6 does not use the proper
    variable type for the allocation size, which might allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PNG
    file that triggers incorrect memory allocation.

  * Automake (derived): Fix for CVE-2012-3386: The "make distcheck"
    rule in GNU Automake before 1.11.6 and 1.12.x before 1.12.2 grants
    world-writable permissions to the extraction directory, which
    introduces a race condition that allows local users to execute
    arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

Bug fixes:

  * PNG: Reading sub-8-bit palette images is fixed (images looked
    stretched).

  * SVG: Fixed bug which allowed MVG and SVG files with long vector
    paths to crash the software.

  * SVG: Ignore XML headers rather than rendering them as text.

  * MVG/SVG/WMF/-draw: It is now possible to draw a plain ','
    character.

  * WMF: Fixed a bug which caused wrong centered-text placement.

  * import: Return status was inverted.

  * configure: Don't force that liblzma is used just because libtiff
    is used.

New Features:

  * The configure script now supports a --enable-quantum-library-names
    option to enable that shared library name includes quantum depth
    to allow shared libraries with different quantum depths to
    co-exist in same directory (only one can be used for development).

  * JNX: Support is added for reading the Garmin proprietary Image
    Format.

  * BMP: Support an alpha channel in uncompressed 32-bit BMP.

Feature improvements:

  * `-lat`: The adaptive threshold algorithm is replaced with a new
    algorithm which scales linearly (rather than quadratically) with
    area size.

  * Tests: Test suite is re-written to use TAP-based tests.

  * GIF: Reader tries to be better at detecting and reporting
    failures.

Performance Improvements:

  * -lat: Adaptive threshold is much faster with large area sizes.

Windows Delegate Updates:

  * Dcraw 9.16 is now included in the build (with JPEG and JPEG2000
    support).

  * Libxml2 is updated to the 2.9.0 release.

  * Libtiff is updated to the 4.0.3 release.

  * Lcms2 is updated to the 2.4 release.

  * Libpng is updated to the 1.5.13 release.

Behavior Changes:

  * Loading modules is only supported for the modules build.
    Previously any build using shared libraries could load modules.

  * Bundled libltdl is now configured as 'installable' rather than
    'convenience'.

  * -enhance: Only filter based on color channels (ignore opacity).

  * BrowseDelegate: Web browser (for viewing help information) now
    defaults to 'xdg-open', but if it is not found, then configure
    will search for firefox, google-chrome, mozilla (in that order).

1.3.16 (June 24, 2012)
==========================

Security Fixes:

  * Don't translate 'comment' and 'label' attributes if the request is
    made while a file is being read.  Only translate such attributes
    if they come from the command line or API user.

Bug fixes:

  * SWT: SWT reader suffered from a number of implementation errors
    which caused it not to work any more.  Works again.

  * XBM: Fix memory leak observed when reading file in 'ping' mode.

  * Support -trim on images which use a consistent (single color)
    transparent background.  In this case, trim is done based on
    opacity rather than foreground color.

  * Include <sys/types.h> in order to assure that 'size_t' and
    'ssize_t' are declared.  This is necessary since
    MagickExtentImage() uses these types as part of its definition.

  * `+repage` was not working because parser was insisting that it
    should include an argument.

  * -units was scaling existing resolution the wrong way around
    (i.e. multiplying rather than dividing).

  * PerlMagick: Fix compilation with Perl 5.16.

  * PingBlob(): PingBlob was not working for all cases.  Is now based
    on BlobToImage() for assured reliability.

New Features:

  None

Feature improvements:

  * MAT: Animated movies inside 4D matrices are loaded now.

  * PDF: File base name is used as the document title.

  * PNG: Fix issues observed specifically with libpng 1.5.10.

Performance Improvements:

  * Pixel iterators should be more efficient now if the image uses a
    file-backed cache.

  * Motion blur algorithm does scale well as cores are added so
    include OpenMP support for it by default.

Windows Delegate Updates:

  * JPEG: Updated to IJG 8d release.

  * PNG: Updated to 1.5.11 release

  * TIFF: Updated to 4.0.2 release.

  * Zlib: Updated to 1.2.7 release.

  * libxml2: Updated to 2.8.0 release.

Behavior Changes:

  None

1.3.15 (April 28, 2012)
==========================

Security Fixes:

  * Libpng in Windows build is updated to 1.5.10 release.  Provides a
    fix for CVE-2011-3048.

Bug fixes:

  * PNG - fixed problem with bit depth when the encoder decides to
    write RGBA instead of indexed PNG.

  * Fixed some temporary file leaks which were caused by the temporary
    file name being automatically extended to include a scene number,
    and therefore fail to be deleted.

New Features:

  * Added '+noise random' and '-operator noise-random' to 'convert'
    and 'mogrify'.  This modulates the existing image data with
    uniformly random noise.

  * Added -strip option in composite, convert, mogrify, and montage to
    remove all profiles and text attributes from the image.

  * Added -repage option to composite, convert, mogrify, and montage
    subcommands to reset or adjust the current image page offsets
    based on a provided geometry specification.

  * New C function StripImage() to remove all profiles and text
    attributes from the image.

  * New C function ResetImagePage() to adjust the current image page
    canvas and position based on a relative page specification.

  * C functions GenerateDifferentialNoise(), AddNoiseImageChannel(),
    QuantumOperatorRegionImage(), AddNoiseImage() updated to support
    RandomNoise enumeration.

  * New C++ Image method strip(), and unary function stripImage() to
    remove all profiles and text attributes from the image.

  * XCF format now respects image subimage and subrange members so
    that returned image layers may be selected.

  * The INFO coder (e.g. output file "info:-") now respects the
    -format option so that its output may be adjusted identically to
    how -format works for 'identify'.

  * TclMagick now supports Random noise.

Feature improvements:

  * C function ThumbnailImage() now allows the user to override the
    filter used, but still defaults to using the box filter.

Performance Improvements:

  * None

Behavior Changes:

  * No longer add a printf-style scene formatting specification to
    filenames which do not have one and no longer automatically
    operate in 'adjoin' mode in such cases.  If multiple numbered
    files are intended to be output, then add +adjoin to the command
    line and use an output filename specification similar to
    "image-%d.jpg".  Output files are now completely specified and
    predictable but this may break some existing usages which
    anticipate the automatic file numbering.

1.3.14 (February 25, 2012)
==========================

Security Fixes:

  * Windows bundled libpng updated to the 1.5.9 release, which fixes
    the dire CVE-2011-3026 buffer overrun bug.

Bug fixes:

  * EMF format : Fixed wrong module mapping which caused EMF reading
    to not work under Windows.

  * TGA format: Assume that 32-bit TGA files have an alpha channel,
    even if they are not marked as such.

  * XCF format: Fix reading XCF which is comprised of different sized
    layers.

  * JPEG & CineonLog: Convert RGB-compatible colorspaces
    (e.g. CineonLog) to RGB by default since that was the case prior
    to release 1.3.13.

  * RAW formats: Small memory leak in dcraw module was fixed.

  * Resize: ResizeImage() was ignoring its resize filter argument and
    was using the filter setting from the Image structure instead.

  * The mirror virtual pixel method was broken.

New Features:

  * Open64 Compiler Suite: Version 5.0 is fully supported.

  * Wand API: Added MagickExtentImage().

  * MEF RAW: Mamiya Photo RAW "MEF" format is now supported.

Feature improvements:

  * DPX format: Original file endianness is preserved by default.

  * PNG library: Updated libpng to 1.5.9 release.

  * TIFF library: Updated libtiff to 4.0.1 release.

  * Zlib library: Updated to zlib 1.2.6 release.

Performance Improvements:

  * Despeckle algorithm (-despeckle) is many times faster.

Behavior Changes:

  * DPX format: Original file endianness is preserved by default.

1.3.13 (December 24, 2011)
==========================

Security Fixes:

  None

Bug fixes:

  * In I/O blob, don't rewind already open file handle passed to
    OpenBlob() since we don't know the intended state of this file
    handle, and because it prevents appending to an existing file.

  * In AppendImageProfile(), don't leak profile buffer while appending
    a chunk to an existing profile.

  * Fix deadlock in ClonePixelCache() which was caused by using the
    same semaphore pointer in the source and destination images.

  * Removed bogus SyncBlob() code which sometimes caused a crash and
    was not useful.

  * Fixed crash or hang which occured when the user entered CONTROL-C
    while threaded code was being executed.

  * Fix core dump in AcquireOneCacheViewPixelInlined() when the image
    is in CMYK space.

  * In MontageImages (montage), fix crash observed with "-geometry
    x+0+0".

  * The TIFF reader was crashing for images which use the
    TIFFTAG_OPIIMAGEID tag.

  * AppendImages() (-append) was failing when only one image was
    provided.

  * The `animate`, `display`, and `identify` commands now report any
    error only once, and then proceed to the next file name rather
    than quitting.

  * Don't change the locale settings in InitializeMagick() since this
    may cause problems for international users.  API users are still
    responsible for assuring that locale settings don't break floating
    point parsing and output (i.e. floating point decimal needs to be
    '.' rather than ',').

  * RPM build is fixed (PerlMagick build was broken).

  * RPM build installs documentation to expected places on Red Hat
    type systems.

  * Fixes for usage with OpenSolaris.

  * DESTDIR is supported by PerlMagick build.

  * The matte channel was not being properly enabled or respected for
    TXT images.

  * InitializeMagick() and DestroyMagick() are now fully thread safe.

  * When a shear angle was zero, the shear request was being
    ignored entirely.

  * In DispatchImage(), the `K` channel was always output as black for
    "CMYK" specification unless the image matte flag was True.

  * MATLAB fixes.

  * PNG fixes.

  * PCL fixes for printing bi-level image on Konica-Minolta printers.

  * EPT error handling fixes.

  * JPEG reader was sometimes truncating large IPTC profiles.

  * JPEG writer now handles errors properly rather than allowing
    libjpeg to exit the program (or hanging if driven by Magick++).

  * JPEG reader now treats an unhandled EXP marker as a warning rather
    than a hard error.

  * File open errors are now reliably reported.

  * Improved rendering precision when using the drawing APIs.

  * For the Magick++ Image backgroundColor(), borderColor(), and
    matteColor() methods, preserve the opacity part of the
    user-specified color.

New Features:

  * Add support for drawing text using a bitmap font.

  * benchmark command supports a -stepthreads option to execute the
    specified command with an increasing number of threads to measure
    how an algorithm benefits from threading.  This mode includes a
    column to show the speedup compared with one thread, and the
    Karp-Flatt metric

  * Added support for invoking "gs-cmyk" and "gs-cmyka" entries in
    delegates.mgk when ColorSeparationType or ColorSeparationMatteType
    is requested.  These cause Ghostscript to always output CMYK PAM
    format (even if the input file was not in CMYK format).

  * EXIF profiles are preserved when writing JPEG files.

  * The -mosaic command now respects the composition option specified
    by -compose as well as the image background color specified by
    -background.

  * The TXT coder now supports multiple image frames.

  * For image normalization (-normalize), add support for
    histogram-threshold setting to specify the percentage of the
    histogram to discard when computing image normalization parameters
    (default is 0.1%).  For example `-set histogram-threshold 0.01
    -normalize`.

  * Added an `INFO` coder which produces textual image description
    output similar to `identify` but may be used with convert like "gm
    convert myfile info:-".

  * Support application of the PDF crop box via '-define
    pdf:use-cropbox=true'.

  * For PCL printer output, define pcl:fit-to-page in order for the
    printer to scale the image to fit the page.

  * Added order dither 5x5, 6x6, and 7x7 circular dither patterns to
    create a halftone effect.

  * PNM subformats are now reported as the specific subformat rather
    than just "PNM".

  * NetPBM's PAM format is now supported.

  * MacPaint image format reader is added.

  * Added TIFF LZMA compressor support.

  * Added TIFF support for a tiff:group-three-options define to allow
    power-users to set the value of the GROUP3OPTIONS tag.

  * New core C API function SetImageColorRegion() to set the constant
    pixel color for a specified region of the image.

  * New Wand C API function MagickWriteImagesFile() to append images
    to a provided file handle.

  * New Wand C API function MagickSetImageSavedType() to allow
    specifying the storage type used when saving the file (rather than
    changing the current image characteristics).

  * In Wand C API, the functions NewPixelWand(), NewDrawingWand(), and
    NewMagickWand() invoke InitializeMagick() automatically in case
    user forgets to do so.

  * New Wand C API function MagickSetFormat() to allow setting the
    file or blob format before it has been read.

  * New Wand C API function MagickSetDepth() to set the depth used
    when reading from an image format which requires that the depth be
    specified in advance.

Feature improvements:

  * Now compiles properly with libpng 1.4.X and 1.5.X.

  * Lcms 2.X is supported.

Performance Improvements:

  * TGA read performance improved.

  * PNM read/write performance improved.

  * Convolution (-convolve, -sharpen, -guassian, etc.) is faster.

  * Adaptive threshold image (-lat) is faster.

  * Image trimming (-trim) is faster.

Behavior Changes:

  * For DPX format and packed 10 bits, datums are now represented in
    the same (reversed) order for all RGB and YCbCr formats.
    Previously YCbCr 4:4:4 formats were not swapping the word datums
    because the only real-world files encountered did not swap the
    word datums.

  * The -colors, -map, and -monochrome options now take effect
    immediately rather than at the end of all other processing.

  * Removed non-standard multi-frame extension for SGI format.

  * Windows install footprint is more consistent between DLL and
    static builds.

  * LZMA compressed tarball is in 'xz' format rather than deprecated
    'lzma' format.

1.3.12 (March 8, 2010)
==========================

Security Fixes:

  * Updated libpng Windows sources to 1.2.43 in order to resolve
    CVE-2010-0205 as it pertains to the GraphicsMagick Windows build.

Bug fixes:

  * Filter mode (write to stdout) was completely broken.

  * Should now compile with libpng 1.4.

  * Windows PerlMagick build identified itself as the wrong version.

New Features:

  * None

Feature improvements:

  * None

Performance Improvements:

  * None

Behavior Changes:

  * DCX output format is only written on request.  Previously the PCX
    coder would automatically switch to DCX format if multiple frames
    would be written.

1.3.11 (February 21, 2010)
==========================

Security Fixes:

  * Fixed array underflow on systems using signed char which could
    result in a program crash due to extended characters in filenames
    or in certain file formats.

Bug fixes:

  * Fixed array underflow on systems using signed char which could
    result in a program crash due to extended characters in filenames
    or in certain file formats.

New Features:

  * Added a -thumbnail command to 'convert' and 'mogrify'.  This is a
    faster way to scale down the image when speed is a primary
    concern.

  * Added a -extent command to 'convert' and 'mogrify' which
    composites the image on top of a backing canvas image of solid
    color.

  * Added support for -compose to the 'convert' and 'mogrify', which
    were documented to support it (but did not).

Feature improvements:

  * None

Performance Improvements:

  * Requests for 'Over' and 'Atop' composition are converted to a
    request for the (faster) 'Copy' composition when both images are
    opaque.

Behavior Changes:

  * None

1.3.10 (February 10, 2010)
==========================

Security Fixes:

  * None

Bug fixes:

  * +adjoin was not working correctly for the case when only one image
    frame is present.  With +adjoin and writing one frame to
    "foo%d.jpg" it was outputting "foo%d.jpg" rather than "foo0.jpg".

  * When drawing paths, memory allocation for the points was much
    larger than it needed to be (patch by Vladimir Lukianov).

New Features:

  * None

Feature improvements:

  * None

Performance Improvements:

  * None

Behavior Changes:

  * To reiterate the change which first appeared in 1.3.9, there is no
    longer an implicit +adjoin if the output file name happens to
    contain a %d sequence, or there are multiple frames and the output
    file format only supports storing one frame.  Specify +adjoin if
    scene number substition is desired in the output file names.

1.3.9 (February 4, 2010)
========================

Security Fixes:

  * None

Bug fixes:

  * Fix "double free" error when using gm import -frame.

  * XPM does not support RGBA color syntax, so return RGB instead.

  * The display '-update' option was only working in conjunction with
    the '-delay' option with a delay setting of 2 or greater.

  * For formats which support multiple frames, output with +adjoin to
    filenames containing a scene specification (e.g. foo%02d.tiff) was
    resulting in wrong output file names.

  * -convolve was crashing rather than reporting an error.

  * Fixed crash if the number of OpenMP threads was reduced from the
    original value via '-limit threads' or omp_set_num_threads().

  * -blur was not blurring the opacity channel for solid-color images.

  * When installing HTML documentation, many files were included which
    are not part of the formatted documentation.

  * Several deleted global string constants are restored with
    deprecated status in order to assure that symbols are not removed
    from the ABI.

New Features:

  * None

Feature improvements:

  * None

Performance Improvements:

  * None

Behavior Changes:

  * There is no longer an implicit 'adjoin' if an output filename
    contains an apparent scene specification (e.g. foo%02d.tiff) and
    multiple files are not needed to save the image..  It is necessary
    to use +adjoin.  For example ``gm convert foo.pdf +adjoin
    %02d.tiff``.

  * -flatten now applies the image background color under the first
    image in the list if it is not already opaque.

1.3.8 (January 21, 2010)
========================

Security Fixes:

  * Fix for CVE-2009-1882 "Integer overflow in the XMakeImage
    function".

  * Fix lockup due to hanging in loop while parsing malformed
    sub-image specification (SourceForge issue 2886560).

  * Libltdl: Updated libtool to 2.2.6b in order to fix security issue.
    Resolves CVE-2009-3736 as it pertains to GraphicsMagick.

Bug fixes:

  * -convolve, -recolor: Validate that user-provided matrix is square
    when parsing -convolve and -recolor commands in order to avoid a
    core dump.

  * CALS: Reading images taller than the image width resulted in a
    failure.

  * ConstituteImage(), DispatchImage(): 'A' and 'T' should indicate
    transparency and 'O' should indicate opacity.  Behavior was
    inconsistent.  In some cases 'O' meant transparency while in other
    cases it meant opacity. Also, in a few cases, matte was not
    getting enabled in the image as it should.

  * DCRAW: Module name was not registered so modules based builds were
    not supporting formats provided via 'dcraw'.

  * GetOptimalKernelWidth1D(), GetOptimalKernelWidth2D(): In the Q32
    build, convolution kernel size was estimated incorrectly for large
    sigmas on 32-bit systems due to arithmetic overflow.  This could
    cause wrong results for -convolve, -blur, -sharpen, and other
    algorithms which use these functions.

  * Image Size: Fixed the ability to pass the image size via the
    filename specification like "myfile.jpg[640x480]" rather than
    needing to use -size.

  * IPTC: Blob data needed to be padded to an even size.  Size is now
    correctly reported.

  * IPTC: Returned IPTC string values were one character too short.

  * Large Files: Large pixel cache files were not working under GNU
    Linux.

  * JP2: Fixed some value scaling problems.

  * JP2: Fix possible crash at exit when Jasper is used by a modules
    build.

  * MPC: is_monochrome and is_grayscale flags were not managed
    properly for the MPC coder.

  * PCL: Page was not always being ejected.

  * PNG: The png8 encoder would fail when trying to write a 1-color
    image.

  * PSD: PSD parser was confused by 0x0 pixel layers, resulting in
    image data corruption of all following layers.

  * -rotate, -shear: Some internally-reported errors were potentially
    being lost.

  * Subrange/stdin: Commands now support reading an image from stdin
    in conjunction with a subrange specification (e.g. "-[1]").

  * Magick++ STL ShadeImage: Implementation was completely botched.

New Features:

  * CALS Type 1 files may now be written (Work contributed by John
    Sergeant).  CALS support is dependent on the TIFF library.

  * GROUP4RAW encoder supports reading/writing RAW Group4 data.

  * JP2: JPEG 2000 may now be written in arbitrary bit depths ranging
    from 2 to 16 rather than just 8 or 16.

  * JPEG: IJG JPEG library version 7 is now supported.

  * JPEG: Added jpeg:block-smoothing and jpeg:fancy-upsampling defines
    to control these JPEG library options.

  * JPEG: Detect and apply colorspaces appropriately for ITU FAX JPEG.

  * Resource Limits: There is now a "threads" resource limit which
    allows specifying the number of OpenMP threads which may be used,
    similar to the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable.

  * TIFF: Allow CIELAB TIFF to be read.

  * MagickGetImageAttribute()/MagickSetImageAttribute(): New Wand
    methods to support getting and setting an image attribute.
    Contributed by Mikko Koppanen.

  * ClonePixelWand(): New Wand method to deep-copy an existing pixel
    wand.

  * ClonePixelWands(): New Wand method to deep-copy an array of
    existing pixel wands.

  * MagickCdlImage(): New Wand method to apply the ASC CDL to an
    image.

  * MagickGetImageBoundingBox(): New Wand method to return the crop
    bounding box required to remove any solid-color border from the
    image.

  * MagickGetImageFuzz(), MagickSetImageFuzz(): New Wand methods to
    get and set the color comparison fuzz factor.

  * MagickHaldClutImage(): New Wand method to apply a Hald CLUT to an
    image.

  * MagickSetResolution(): New Wand method to set the wand resolution.

  * MagickSetResolutionUnits(): New Wand method to set the wand
    resolution units.

  * Magick++: Allow Magick++ library to built as a DLL under MinGW and
    Cygwin.  This requires a modern GCC in order for C++ exceptions to
    work.

Feature improvements:

  * Cygwin: Cygwin 1.7 is now supported.

  * JPEG compression settings are preserved (if possible) when
    inserting JPEG blobs into formats which use JPEG.

  * PDF: If the original file used JPEG compression, then use JPEG
    compression with original settings (if possible).

  * TIFF: Update Windows build to use libtiff 3.9.2.

  * X11 Display: Apply a checkerboard pattern underneath transparent
    images which use more than simple binary transparency.

Performance Improvements:

  * Gamma: Performance is improved for Q8 and Q16 builds.  Also
    preserve full precision in Q32 build.

  * String data is dealt with a bit more efficiently (fewer
    allocations, less memory, and less CPU).

Behavior Changes:

  * InitializeMagick() MUST be invoked prior to using any Magick API
    function.  Failure to do so will likely lead to an immediate
    application crash.  This is due to initialization and runtime
    changes intended to improve thread safety and efficiency.
    Previously it was only strongly recommended to invoke
    InitializeMagick().

  * ConstituteImage(), DispatchImage(): 'A' and 'T' should indicate
    transparency and 'O' should indicate opacity.  Behavior was
    inconsistent.  In some cases 'O' meant transparency while in other
    cases it meant opacity. Also, in a few cases, matte was not
    getting enabled in the image as it should.

  * colors.mgk: Is now empty to default and is optional.  Previous
    content is now compiled into the library in an efficient way, but
    existing values may be modified, or new values added by adding
    entries to color.mgk.

  * DisableSlowOpenMP is now the default.  Use --enable-openmp-slow to
    enable OpenMP for algorithms which sometimes run slower rather
    than faster.

  * magic.mgk: This configuration file is no longer used since this
    data is now compiled into the library in an efficient way.

  * modules.mgk: Is now empty to default and is optional.  Previous
    content is now compiled into the library in an efficient way, but
    existing values may be modified, or new values added by adding
    entries to modules.mgk.

  * Third party executables not included in the Visual Studio build
    are no longer bundled in the GraphicsMagick installer.  This means
    that hp2xx.exe, mpeg2dec.exe, and mpeg2enc.exe are no longer
    distributed.

1.3.7 (September 17, 2009)
==========================

Security Fixes:

  * PCX: Detect improper rows, columns, or depth.  Fixes CVE-2008-1097
    "Memory corruption in ImageMagick's PCX coder".

  * DrawDashPolygon: Avoid a crash which sometimes occured with tiny
    polygons.

Bug fixes:

  * JPEG: Profile chunks need to be concatenated in order to build
    the whole profile.  This was not working so embedded profiles
    larger than 32K or maybe 64K were being corrupted.  This bug was
    introduced in GraphicsMagick 1.2.

  * Meta: Fix memory leaks.

  * Meta: Work better with with IPTC record 2 blocks and deal better
    with IPTC embedded in an 8BIM profile.  Fixes by John Sergeant.

  * MPC: Fix crash when reading MPC and the input image is modified.

  * PNG: Ensure that the opacity channel is properly initialized.

  * -profile: Lowercase arguments were sometimes not working as
    expected.

  * Topol: Topol reader actually works now and is included in test
    suite.

  * TIFF: Read and write JPEG-compressed grayscale TIFF correctly.

  * VisualMagick configure now works properly when output paths are
    specified.

  * WMF: Eliminate memory leaks.

New Features:

  * MagickWand: New method MagickSetCompressionQuality() to allow
    setting the compression quality.

  * MagickWand: New method CloneDrawingWand() to deep-copy a drawing
    wand.

  * MagickWand: New method DrawGetException() to retrieve information
    regarding the last drawing wand exception (if any).

  * MagickWand: New method DrawClearException() to clear a drawing wand
    exception.

  * Magick++: New Image method cdl() to apply the ASC CDL.

  * Magick++: New Image method colorMatrix() to apply a color matrix
    to the image channels.

  * Magick++: New Image method haldClut() to apply a color lookup
    table (Hald CLUT) to the image.

  * MSL/Conjure: Added a new 'profile' command which applies, adds, or
    removes one or more IPTC, ICC or generic profiles from a file.
    Work contributed by John Sergeant.

  * Added a 'time' subcommand to provide Unix-style 'time' output when
    a 'time' capability is missing, or the reporting format is
    inconsistent.  For example 'gm time convert ...'.

Feature improvements:

  * ColorMatrixImage(): Add opaque opacity channel when needed.

  * PDF & PS: Use '-type palette' prior to input file name to cause
    Ghostscript to return a dithered colormapped image.

  * PNG: Now compiles with libpng-1.4.0beta74 and later.

  * TIFF: Libtiff in Windows build is upgraded to 3.9.1.  This allows
    GraphicsMagick to read and write 16 and 24 bit float TIFF files.

  * Windows code to find Ghostscript is rewritten from scratch.

Performance Improvements:

  * Drawing of points, lines, and polygons (and complex shapes based
    on these) is now accelerated using OpenMP with excellent speed-up.

  * ICC color transforms now see linear speedup from OpenMP.

  * Rotate: For rotations of 90 or 270 degrees, tile sizes are
    selected more appropriately.

Behavior Changes:

  * No longer clear the exception structure at the start of
    ReadImage() and other similar functions since this sometimes masks
    errors.  The API user is expected to make sure that the exception
    structure is clean prior to invoking a function.

  * SVG: Writer is now disabled since it usually does not work properly.

1.3.6 (July 25, 2009)
=====================

Security Fixes:

  * None.

Bug fixes:

  * Composition was failing when the change image overlaps off the
    left side of the canvas.

  * EPT, PDF, PS: PDF bounding box is sometimes incorrect or not
    globally applicable so don't specify bounding box when reading PDF
    files.

  * OpenMP: Fix (benign) multi-thread cross-contentions (detected by
    valgrind's Helgrind).

  * TIFF: Fix problem with reading one bit per sample RGB images.

  * TIFF: Writer was using rows-per-strip of 8 when writing
    JPEG-compressed TIFF.  This does not work for vertical
    subsampling, and some TIFF readers insist on 16.  The
    rows-per-strip is now required to be a multiple of 16.

  * TIFF: In some cases, the TIFF reader and writer were accessing
    planar TIFF in row-order rather than plane-order, which resulted
    in sever buffering problems in libtiff, and failure when
    compression was used.

  * -write now works usefully as documented.

  * Temporary file name generator was not random enough, resulting in
    some file name collisions for GraphicsMagick processes started at
    the same time.

  * PerlMagick: Fixed Ping on a BLOB.

  * GetImageDepth was leaking memory.

  * Convert/mogrify -mask option was leaking memory.

  * Mogrify -output-directory option was leaking memory.

  * DPX: Fixed memory leak encountered when subsampling to 4:2:2.

  * DPX: Values read received insuficient scaling, which round-tripped
    correctly, but rounded-down excessively if any image processing
    was applied.

New Features:

  * Added HRS reader for slow scan TV (contributed by Fojtik Jaroslav).

  * Pthreads (POSIX threads) API may now be used under the WIN32 API.

  * New access confirmation facility (MagickConfirmAccess) to allow
    the API user to monitor and/or block access to files and URLs.
    This allows the API user to implement a security policy based on
    actual accesses.

  * New color matrix function (ColorMatrixImage) to apply a color
    matrix similar to Adobe Flash Flash.filters.colorMatrixFilter(),
    and Windows GDI+ ColorMatrix class, (order up to 5x5) to the image
    pixels.  This is accessible via the -recolor command option.

  * Added an IDENTITY coder to return a Hald identity CLUT image of
    specified order (e.g. "identity:8").

  * Added a Hald CLUT capability as described at
    http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html.  This allows a
    color transformation to be easily created and replicated on any
    number of images.  The algorithm is accessed by the -hald-clut
    option of 'convert' and 'mogrify'.  Original algorithm by Eskil
    Steenberg and adapted for GraphicsMagick by Clment Follet, with
    additional work by Bob Friesenhahn.

  * Added support for the ASC CDL transform.  Available as -asc-cdl
    via the 'convert' and 'mogrify' subcommands.  Original
    implementation by Clment Follet but considerably re-worked by Bob
    Friesenhahn.  Implementation passes the +/- 1 count accuracy
    requirement required by the ASC CDL SOP tests.

  * Added support for reading CALS Type 1 format (contributed by John
    Sergeant).  CALS is a standard raster format used by the US
    Department of Defense for storing blueprint images.

  * Added a random number generation system based on George
    Marsaglia's multiply-with-carry generator.  Somewhat slower than
    rand() but produces better random numbers with a period >2^60.
    This is a much better random number generator than the C library
    rand() and the algorithm is integrated in a way which maximizes
    multi-thread performance.

  * The 'compare' command now supports a -maximum-error option to
    specify the maximum image error so that it may be used to support
    boolean logic in automated test scripts.

  * For OpenMP-builds, the '-list resource' output now indicates the
    number of threads which will be used.

Feature improvements:

  * Image resize now avoids adding "halos" around objects when
    resizing an image which contains transparency (patch contributed by
    Pavel Merdin).

  * DICOM: The DICOM reader is completely re-written and is much more
    functional now.  A few features (e.g. RLE compression) are still
    missing.  This work is contributed by John Sergeant.

  * EXIF: Unprintable characters in EXIF attribute strings are now
    returned using three-digit octal notation.  Unknown tags are
    identified via their four-character hex value.

  * PCL: PCL writer is rewritten to fix many bugs, add support for
    compression, add support for 8 bit PseudoClass images, and
    dramatically improve usability (work contributed by John Sergeant).

  * TIFF: Allow the user to force the returned image to be TrueColor
    type for min-is-white and min-is-black TIFF files.

  * TIFF: User can now specify the predictor using syntax like
    '-define tiff:predictor=2'.

  * TIFF: User can now specify the rows-per-strip value when using
    JPEG compression.

  * TXT: The TXT reader is now capable of reading image files written
    by the TXT writer, as well continuing to render ASCII text into an
    image (work contributed by Fojtik Jaroslav).

  * Utilities @file.txt syntax for including a list of files to use as
    an argument now really works as expected.  This may be used to
    inject any other text into the command line as well.  As a result,
    the 'mogrify' utility may be invoked on thousands of files at once
    while obtaining the list of files to process from a text file.

  * The 'mogrify' utility now caches argument images so that they are
    loaded only once when mogrify is used to process multiple image
    files.

Performance Improvements:

  * -median and -noise now see reliable linear speedup as threads are
    added.

Behavior Changes:

  * PerlMagick is configured but no longer built by default.

  * Use '-interlace Line' to produce an interlaced GIF, PNG, or
    progressive JPEG.

1.3.5 (January 26, 2009)
=========================

  * BMP and DIB formats were throwing an assertion for negative height
    values.  This caused the process to crash.

Bug fixes:

  * Don't install Magick++ headers if C++ is disabled.

  * Linux RPM SPEC file needs to always install the loadable module
    .la files or else the modules won't load.

1.3.3 (December 9, 2008)
========================

Security Fixes:

  * None.

Bug fixes:

  * 'identify' was throwing an assertion when used on colormapped
    files (this bug was introduced by 1.3.2).

  * With the -segment option, eliminate trashing the image colors when
    used on huge images.

  * 'identify -format "%c"' now reports the entire comment regardless
    of size.

  * Argument to -convolve is no longer arbitrarily truncated so huge
    convolution kernels may now be specified from the command line.

Performance Improvements:

  * Image segmentation (-segment) is now accelerated using OpenMP and
    uses several other tactics to improve execution performance.

  * 'identify "*"' now successfully works in a 32-bit application when
    used in a directory containing a million files.

  * 'identify' now executes quickly when used on TIFF files.

1.3.2 (November 29, 2008)
=========================

Security Fixes:

  * None.

Bug fixes:

  * -roll was failing for colormapped images.

  * VID: Memory leak fix.

  * PREVIEW: Solarize parameter was wrong.

  * Delegates previously using 'spawn' needed an ampersand so that
    starting the child process does not hang the GUI.

Feature improvements:

  * +profile now supports an exclusion syntax.  For example ``+profile
    '!icm,*'`` removes all of the profiles except for the ICM profile.
    The new syntax also allows multiple profiles to be listed at once.

Performance Improvements:

  * AdaptiveThreshold, Blur, Convolve, and MotionBlur no longer
    process the opacity channel unless the image has one.

1.3.1 (November 17, 2008)
=========================

Security Fixes:

  * None.

Bug fixes:

  * RPM build, Fixes to successfully build binary RPMs for Red Hat
    Linux 4.

  * MSL/conjure, Fix bug with attributes becoming appended to
    themselves.  Fix memory leaks.

Feature improvements:

  * New --disable-openmp-slow configure option for disabling use of
    OpenMP for algorithms which may run slower on operating systems
    with crummy thread libraries.

  * JPEG, Allow user to specify DCT encoding method via
    jpeg:dct-method define.  Also allow control over whether huffman
    encoding is used via jpeg:optimize-coding define.

Performance Improvements:

  * OpenMP (parallel processing) improvements for these functions:

    - Rotate by 90 and 270 degrees (-rotate)

1.3 (November 9, 2008)
======================

Security fixes:

  * AVI reader: Re-worked to be more robust against crash or DOS.

    optimize is requested, or the image is colormapped.

  * Configure: Fixed the --enable-magick-compat configure option, which
    had stopped working.

  * Configure: Fixed --without-magick-plus-plus so that it works again.  This
    stopped working in the 1.2 release cycle.

  * Configure: Fixed MagickLibVersion text string generation so that it
    is now correct when a component of the release number exceeds '9'.
    Now components can safely count up to '99' before there is a problem.

New Utilities:

  * A 'benchmark' subcommand is now available to benchmark the
    performance of any other arbitrary subcommand (e.g. 'convert').

Feature improvements:

  * LZW compression is now enabled by default.
  * Support industry-standard subsampling notation like "4:2:2".
  * If gm is executed under a traditional alternate name (e.g.
    convert), it will invoke the appropriate sub-command. This allows
    use of hard links, symbolic links, or just copying 'gm' to the
    desired sub-command name in order to achieve 100% ImageMagick 5.5.2
    utility compatibility.
  * Provide the --enable-magick-compat option when configuring to install
    ImageMagick utilities compatibility links.
  * Identify -verbose output includes normalized (0.0-1.0) statistics.
  * Identify and convert now print "pixels per second" rates to help
    evaluate performance.
  * Added the identify +ping option to force reading the complete file.
  * The display program now supports the +progress option to disable any
    visual progress indication (and hourglass cursor) while loading images.
  * Support writing grayscale TGA files.
  * Provide explicit support for Rec 601 and Rec 709 grayscale spaces.
  * Include some support for a log RGB space based on the 2.048 density
    range as defined for the Cineon Digital Film System.
  * Added utilities command-line support for industry standard subsampling
    notation like 4:4:4 and 4:2:2.
  * Use MAGICK_IOBUF_SIZE to tune the size of the I/O buffer.
  * Use -type Bilevel, Grayscale, TrueColor, or TrueColorMatte to
    influence the type of image that Ghostscript returns.
  * Use '-define tiff:fill-order={msb2lsb|lsb2msb}' to control TIFF bit
    fill order.
  * The -version option now dumps a feature list as well as the build
    options.
  * The -endian option now supports the option 'native'.
  * A -monitor is added to enable progress monitoring for the command line
    utilities.
  * Use the -output-directory option to 'mogrify' to send output files to
    the specified directory.
  * Use the -create-directories option in conjunction with
    -output-directory and 'mogrify' to create any necessary subdirectories.
  * A Pixels resource limit is added.  Use '-limit Pixels value' to limit
    the maximum number of pixels in an image to 'value'.
  * The already supported option '-type Optimize' is now honored by
    formats that need to choose a subformat based on the properties of
    the image. Grueling tests of many/all pixels are not performed
    unless '-type Optimize' is supplied.
  * Added a a -set option to the composite, convert, display, mogrify,
    import commands in order to allow setting an image attribute.
  * Display utility no longer defaults to reading from standard input if
    stdin is not a tty.
  * May now be configured to use the umem memory allocation library
    available in Solaris 9, Update 3 and later, or from the portable umem
    project.

Coder additions/improvements:

  * Replaced existing DPX "support" with all-new DPX support conforming
    to the SMPTE 268M-2003 standard.
  * Cineon reader completely rewritten.
  * TIFF coder is completely re-written. Now supports reading and
    writing RGB, CMYK, and grayscale, scanline-oriented TIFF images
    with arbitrary (1 to 32 bits) depth. Includes support for tiled
    TIFF, floating point TIFF, LogLuv TIFF, BigTIFF, arbitrary depths,
    and associated alpha.
  * TIFF coder now supports retrieving and saving XMP profiles.
  * MATLAB support is much improved and supports writing as well.
  * WPG reader now supports CTM translations.
  * ART format now supports writing.
  * Support 32-bit raw RGB images.
  * Support 32-bit raw CMYK images.
  * Support 32-bit raw gray images.
  * JP2 coder reads images in YCbCr colorspace and retrieves an embedded
    ICC ICM color profile if present.

API enhancements:

  * Added ExportImageChannel() and ImportImageChannel() APIs to support
    exporting and importing pixel regions with an arbitary range of (1
    to 32) bits per quantum.
  * Added image leveling methods for Magick++.
  * Generalized GetImageAttribute() support for retrieving wildcarded
    attributes so that an identify -format specification like
    ``"%[dpx:*]"`` works as expected.
  * Incorporated changes changes necessary so that GraphicsMagick can
    work with the Ch C/C++ interpreter from SoftIntegration at
    http://www.softintegration.com/.
  * Added MagickAllocFunctions() to allow the API user to replace the
    underlying memory allocator functions.
  * Added MagickMalloc() and deprecated AcquireMemory().
  * Added MagickCloneMemory() and deprecated CloneMemory().
  * Added MagickMallocArray() to safely allocate N items of size S.
  * Added MagickRealloc() and deprecated ReacquireMemory().
  * Added MagickFree() and deprecated LiberateMemory().

Performance improvments:

  * The DispatchImage() and ConstituteImage() functions incorporate
    special case code for BGR, BGRO, BGRP, RGB, RGBO, and I formats (8
    bit only) in order to improve performance dramatically.
  * When writing very large JPEG images, don't enable Huffman compression
    since doing so requires libjpeg to buffer the entire image in memory.
  * When using the 'identify' -verbose option, -verbose must be specified
    twice in order to obtain the color count.  This makes normal use of
    -verbose much faster.
  * Significantly improved read/write speed for bilevel and gray images.
  * TIFF I/O is considerably faster.
  * Postscript writer is 10-15X faster.
  * PNM formats writer is 10-100X faster.
  * Rotate by 90 or 270 degrees is 2-9X faster.

Windows-specific improvements/changes:

  * For the MinGW and Cygwin builds, the Magick++ library is forced to
    build as a static library since otherwise C++ exceptions don't work.
  * MinGW cross-build is available from a Linux or FreeBSD host.
  * Determine location of Ghostscript fonts only once in order to improve
    performance.
  * Updated bzip2 to 1.0.4.
  * Updated Jasper library to version 1.900.1.
  * Updated jbigkit to 1.6
  * Updated lcms to 1.17
  * Updated libpng to 1.2.27.
  * Updated libtiff to 3.8.2
  * Updated zlib to 1.2.3.
  * Libtiff supports LZW compression.
  * X11 is no longer part of the default build and will not be included
    in the distributed install packages (but can still be built).
  * Find latest Ghostscript which idenfies itself as "GPL Ghostscript".
  * Use GlobalMemoryStatusEx(), if available, to determine how much
    physical memory is available. Important for large-memory machines.
  * Fixed NTreaddir() so that it does not write beyond its buffer.
  * Fixed opendir() emulation function so it can't overwrite the stack.
  * FlashPIX library sources are no longer distributed in the Windows
    source package and building FlashPIX is disabled by default.
    FlashPIX may still be built by adding the library (separately
    distributed).
  * Fix bitmap handle leak in CropImageToHBITMAP() and ImageToHBITMAP().

1.1 (Released April 4, 2004)
============================

Bug fixes:

  * Semaphore fix which is necessary for proper multi-threaded operation.
  * Configure script fix to ensure that -lfpx is not supplied to the C
    compiler during subsequent tests since this fails on some systems.
  * Fix for East and West gravity computations.
  * System error reports (errno) associated with an exception are now
    correctly obtained from the context existing when the exception was
    thrown rather than the context of the reporting function.
  * JNG encoder fix. Files were being written with incorrect
    alpha_sample_value in the header. These can be repaired by reading
    them into GM 1.1 and rewriting them.
  * XPM fix to module registration.
  * PSD fix for index calculation when QuantumDepth>8.
  * Validate that geometry specifications only include allowed
    characters.
  * SGI fix to save compression type while writing.
  * EXIF attributes were not being retrieved when requested.
  * Fix for bug when reading an image via a user-provided file
    descriptor.
  * The reported image magick string is now always that of the original
    input file (it was sometimes being reported as the format produced by
    an intermediate delegate program).
  * Fixes to color profiling of CMYK images.
  * Memory leak fixed in DrawClipPath().
  * Arc drawing is fixed.
  * Command-line parsing bug under Linux due to Linux's sscanfs
    inability to parse strings like "0x1" as "%fx%f" is fixed.
  * Scaling of 5 and 6-bit colors was slightly incorrect in BMP, AVI,
    DIB, and TIM datastreams.
  * GM utility now reports an error rather than silently returning if
    an unsupported sub-command is provided.
  * TIFF coder was writing 16-bit per sample RGB images incorrectly on
    little-endian CPUs.

Performance improvements:

  * Texture tiling is now 7X faster.
  * Color profile processing speed improvements for colormapped images.

Utilities enhancements:

  * For Unix, 'gm version' now includes a dump of the configure and
    build parameters.
  * Logging of thrown exceptions is now supported. Use '-debug
    exception'. This is useful to learn when and where errors are
    reported.
  * The -define option is added in order to support supplying
    additional options to coders without needing to add additional
    command line options or structure members.
  * The output of 'gm identify -verbose' now provides a nice dump
    of EXIF data.
  * The -sampling-factor option now accepts as many HxV pairs as
    there are JPEG components.  Omitted ones default to 1x1.
  * The convert and montage commands now support an -operator command to
    perform arithmetic and bitwise operations on specified image channels.

Coder additions/improvements

  * The META coder supports wide characters for the IPTC and 8BIM
    formats.
  * The XTRN coder now supports wide characters.
  * An "IMAGE" coder is provided which provides access to a large
    number of images (derived from XFig) suitable for use as patterns,
    or as test images.
  * The "PATTERN" coder now returns an image pattern tiled to size
    (equivalent results to TILE:IMAGE:pattern). This is for ImageMagick
    compatibility.
  * The CINEON coder now supports reading and writing images in CINEON
    "CIN" linear gray and RGB formats. The read support is still very
    weak, but it works for common images.
  * The JPEG coder now estimates the original JPEG quality and sampling
    factors and will reuse these options when writing JPEG if the image
    is of the same type and the option "-define JPEG:preserve-settings"
    is supplied.
  * The JPEG-2000 coder now supports all Jasper library arguments using
    command line syntax similar to '-define jp2:rate=0.5'.
  * Reading and writting compressed SVG (SVGZ) is now supported.
  * The TXT coder now observes depth when writing.
  * The TIFF coder now outputs colormapped images with 1, 2, 4, and 8
    bits per sample in order to provide much smaller file sizes for
    images with very few colors.
  * Many TIFF coder enhancements. Now reads colormapped and grayscale
    images at arbitrary (even odd) bits-per-sample sizes. Now properly
    supports an opacity channel (at any bits-per-sample value) for
    grayscale images. Bilevel grayscale images are treated similar to any
    other grayscale image unless CCITT FAX3/FAX4 compression is
    requested. Now allows the user to specify an arbitrary
    bits-per-sample value for grayscale images (even odd values) using
    "-define tiff:bits-per-sample=value". Now automatically stores the
    image as TrueColor RGB pixels if the image compression is set to JPEG.
    TIFF files are now written in using the TIFF library's default endian
    order rather than always big endian.
  * The WPG coder now renders embedded WMFs.
  * The PS3 coder is completely re-written to work much better and
    support more features (see ChangeLog).

Code structure enhancements:

  * Error handling has been improved and validated through testing.
    Some errors were being lost, unnecessarily ignored, or reported as
    something else entirely.
  * The number of error text messages to be maintained has been reduced
    by consolidating similar messages.
  * The memory allocator functions have been replaced with similar
    macros in order to eliminate warnings with GCC 3.3, avoid
    accidentally casting away const, and allow memory debuggers to
    report memory allocations and frees against the correct functions.
    The previously-used functions remain in the library for the purpose
    of compatibility.
  * <magick/xwindow.h> no longer depends on magick_config.h defines.
  * The text string localization code has been replaced with a simpler
    version written by Bill Radcliffe.
  * Added key,value "map" APIs (somewhat similar to C++'s <map>) for
    internal use.

API enhancements:

  * Incorporated John Cristy's Wand API's in a new GraphicsMagickWand
    library.
  * API definition is no longer dependent on types which vary in size
    (e.g. size_t) depending on large file compilation options.  This means
    that applications may now be compiled without any special large file
    options and still work properly with the library.
  * Thrown exceptions (ExceptionInfo structure) now include source
    file, source line, function name, and current system error number.
  * The GetMagickInfoArray() function is added to replace use of
    GetMagickInfo() for code which needs to access the coder list. This
    is necessary since invoking GetMagickInfo() may re-order the coder
    list, causing problems for code which traverses the list. Using
    GetMagickInfo() to access individual list elements is safe.
  * Added the CopyException function to support copying exception info
    from one structure to another.
  * Added the ReplaceImageInList function to replace an image in an
    image list.
  * Added the DrawPeekGraphicContext function to access the current
    DrawInfo structure in the drawing context stack. Use of this
    function is not recommended since it voilates proper programming
    practices. It is added to support the Wand API's.
  * GetImageDepth() now returns an integral value between 1 and
    QuantumDepth and is no longer limited to the values 8, 16, and 32.
  * SetImageDepth() supports setting the image modulus depth to any
    integral value between 1 and QuantumDepth. This effects the effective
    numeric precision, not the storage depth, since the quantum storage
    type is still a Quantum.
  * GetImageChannelDepth() supports retrieving the modulus depth for a
    specified channel.
  * SetImageChannelDepth() supports setting the modulus depth for a
    specified channel.
  * ProfileImage is updated to handle alpha channels and grayscale
    images.
  * Added GetImageProfile() to retrieve a CMS profile from an image.
  * Added SetImageProfile() to attach a CMS profile to an image without
    adjusting the image pixels.
  * Added DeleteImageProfile() to remove a CMS profile from an image.
  * ConstituteImage() and DispatchImage() now support 'T' (transparency),
    'O' (opacity), and 'P' (pad) options.
  * CompositeImage() now supports CopyCyanCompositeOp,
    CopyMagentaCompositeOp, CopyYellowCompositeOp, and
    CopyBlackCompositeOp, composition operators.
  * GetColorHistogram() obtains a color histogram for the image.
  * QuantumOperatorImage() and QuantumOperatorRegionImage() support
    arithmetic and bitwise operations on specified image channels.
  * The semaphore.h header is no longer installed or included in the
    API headers since these functions are private interfaces.
  * Configure using --enable-symbol-prefix or define
    PREFIX_MAGICK_SYMBOLS to use the C preprocessor to prefix all library
    symbols with "Gm". This prevents library symbol conflicts with other
    libraries.

PerlMagick fixes:

  * Adjusted a number of function option names so that they match the
    documentation.
  * Memory leak fixed.
  * Reading files (e.g. GIF) via a file descriptor is fixed.

Build improvements:

  * The TRIO library may be used to provide a replacement for vsnprintf
    if the C library doesn't provide it.  This improves security on old
    systems.
  * Configure only configures for C & C++ languages.
  * Configure now does a better job of figuring out how to build a
    thread-safe library across multiple operating systems.
  * Configure incorporates a new mmap() test which tests the
    functionality which is needed so that mmap() is not unnecessarily
    rejected on a number of systems. This improves performance for large
    files on those systems.
  * Configure/build fixes for IBM's AIX operating system.

Windows-specific improvements:

  * The static install package now uses the "uninstalled"
    configuration so that it does not depend on the Windows registry in
    order to run. This allows files from the static install package to
    be copied to another computer without running an installer.
  * The executable search path is extended at run-time to include the
    directory where the CORE DLLs reside in order to ensure that they
    are found.
  * Adding the -t option to VisualMagick configure enables building
    all of the coders into one library in order to save build time and
    simplify linkage.
  * The XTRN coder now supports wide characters.
  * LCMS library updated to version 1.10.
  * GMDisplay displays a checkerboard pattern behind transparent images.
  * Support is provided for issuing log messages to the Windows standard
    logging system.
  * Project files are now provided for use with Borland C++ Builder 6.0.
  * Updated LCMS version to 1.12.
  * Updated FreeType version to 2.1.5.
  * Updated JBIG-KIT to version 1.5.
  * Updated libpng to version 1.2.5.
  * Updated libwmf to version 0.2.8.2.
  * Updates zlib to version 1.2.1.
  * ActivePerl 5.8.1 Build 807 now supported.
  * GraphicsMagick now compiles using Visual Studio .NET 2003.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0 (Released in May, 2003)
===========================

GraphicsMagick support services:

  * Master web site at "http://www.GraphicsMagick.org/".
  * Mailing lists, bug tracking, and forums available via
    "https://sourceforge.net/projects/graphicsmagick/".
  * Mercurial Web via "http://hg.code.sf.net/p/graphicsmagick/code/".
  * Mercurial mirror via SourceForge (find instructions at
    "http://www.graphicsmagick.org/Hg.html").
  * FTP via "ftp://ftp.graphicsmagick.org/pub/GraphicsMagick".

Project maintenance improvements:

  * ChangeLog conforms to the GNU standard and all CVS commits include
    useful log messages.
  * CVS commit messages posted to graphicsmagick-commit mail list.
  * CVS commit messages contain CVSWeb URL references.

Footprint changes from ImageMagick:

  * Library -lMagick renamed to -lGraphicsMagick.
  * Library -lMagick++ renamed to -lGraphicsMagick++.
  * Utilities consolidated into a single 'gm' utility (e.g. use 'gm
    convert').
  * Script Magick-config renamed to GraphicsMagick-config.
  * Script Magick++-config renamed to GraphicsMagick++-config.
  * Headers installed under ${PREFIX}/include/GraphicsMagick.
  * PerlMagick namespace renamed from "Image::Magick" to "Graphics::Magick".
  * Pkgconfig files GraphicsMagick.pc and GraphicsMagick++.pc are
    installed in $libdir/pkgconfig to assist pkg-config users.
  * Coder modules installed to lib/GraphicsMagick-1.0/modules-Q8/coders.
  * Filter modules installed to lib/GraphicsMagick-1.0/modules-Q8/filters.

Many performance enhancements:

  * Default QuantumDepth is 8 since this is adequate for most purposes
    and more efficient than 16.
  * The Magick++ demo (compiled with QuantumDepth=8 and -O2) runs about
    1.8X faster under SPARC/Solaris than the same demo with ImageMagick
    5.5.4.
  * Colorspace transformations are much faster.
  * Grayscale/monochrome image handling is much faster.
  * PseudoClass image handling is faster.
  * Text annotations using FreeType are much faster.
  * Image file I/O is much faster.
  * RLE-compressed MIFF reading much faster.

Code structure enhancements:

  * All utility support functions moved to magick/command.c in order to
    significantly reduce link dependencies, allowing statically-linked
    programs to be smaller.
  * Use of MogrifyImage() eliminated except for by utilities.
  * Re-builds due to changes to <magick/image.h> reduced by splitting the
    header into multiple headers.
  * ISO C '99 typedefs (gm_int16_t, gm_uint16_t, gm_int32_t, gm_uint32_t,
    gm_int64_t, gm_uint64_t) are available for use.

Feature enhancements:

  * Module loader always enabled for shared builds to allow extension.
  * Loading of arbitrary filter modules (via -process option) supported
    under Unix as well as Windows.
  * SVG coder allows specifying size and initial background color.
  * JPEG-2000 coder (JP2) updated to work with Jasper 1.7.
  * HWB and HSL image colorspace translation support.
  * JNG/MNG/PNG format support tracks ImageMagick version.
  * BMP encoder can write 16-color indexed BMPs now as well as 2-color
    BMPs (not restricted to monochrome).
  * TIFF decoder now includes optimized support for tiled and stripped
    TIFF.
  * The -random-threshold option (RandomThresholdImage()) is added to
    threshold an image to bilevel using random thresholding.

Major bug fixes:

  * 100% successful test completion at all quantum depths (8/16/32).
  * A temporary file management subsystem is added to ensure that all
    temporary files are removed before program exit. Temporary files are
    created and used in a secure fashion to avoid the possibility that a
    "trojan" temporary file (e.g. a symbolic link, or a file containing
    unsafe content) is created before a delegate has the chance to write
    to it. The environment variable MAGICK_TMPDIR allows the user to
    specify where temporary files are created without altering where
    other programs create their temporary files. Temporary filenames are
    created in 8+3 format to hopefully be more acceptable to ralcgm.
  * When dithering is disabled, don't dither when converting to a
    PseudoClass, grayscale, or monochrome image. Disabling dithering
    may cause these translations to be much faster.
  * PICON format works with BLOBs.
  * No longer removes input file when pinging a FlashPIX file.
  * Arc drawing and texture fill fixes from ImageMagick.
  * Sample, scale and affine fixes from ImageMagick.
  * MIFF colormaps are now scaled properly while reading.
  * CMYK translation works for QuantumDepth=32.
  * ConstituteImage now works properly for grayscale images.
  * Built-in tilde expansion and filename globbing now works properly.
  * InitializeMagick now registers signal handlers to ensure that
    resources are released before program exit.  This helps avoid
    temporary file leaks due to the user using "CONTROL-C".
  * The installed <magick/magick_config.h> header now only contains
    the few definitions required by the API headers.  This should
    significantly reduce or eliminate conflicts with other package
    headers.

Windows platform enhancements:

  * Configure updated for Visual C++ 7.0.
  * OLE object (ImageMagickObject) re-written to work with Visual C++ 7.0
  * New function, CropImageToHBITMAP(), to return a region of the image
    as a Windows HBITMAP.
  * Use vsnprintf to format strings under Windows (safer).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

On November 19, 2002, GraphicsMagick was created as a fork of
ImageMagick, several days before the ImageMagick 5.5.2 release.

The objectives of GraphicsMagick are to:

  * Use an open development model.
  * Encourage new developers to join the project.
  * Avoid unnecessary source code "churn".
  * Establish and preserve a stable API.
  * Use efficient coding practices which result in fast code.
  * Improve memory efficiency.
  * Use a release process which assures a working product.
  * Maintain an accurate ChangeLog.
