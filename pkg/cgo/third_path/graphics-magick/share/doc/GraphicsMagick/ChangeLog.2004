2004-12-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/operator.c: New file for quantum operator implementation.
	(QuantumOperatorImage): Moved from image.c.
	(QuantumOperatorRegionImage): Moved from from image.c.

2004-12-22  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* magick/Makefile.am (MAGICK_BASE_SRCS): Remove mention of
	non-existent mmath.h.

	* magick/gem.c (Modulate): Hue argument now represents a rotation
	from -180 degrees to +180 degrees expressed as an argument of 0 to
	2.0 (1.0 for no change). Note that this change also effects the
	-modulate argument and the Magick++ modulate method(). This change
	is made because the previous hue adjustment strategy only
	succeeded in corrupting the image.

2004-12-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/nt_base.c (opendir): Ensure that data may not overwrite

2004-10-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/resource.c (InitializeMagickResources): Use
	GlobalMemoryStatusEx if it is available.

	* magick/nt_base.c (lt_dlopen): Handle errors while loading
	modules rather than allow Windows to display a GUI dialog box.
	(NTKernelAPISupported): New function to support testing to see if
	a Windows kernel API is supported.

	functions.  Big job!

	* GCC warnings reduction.

	* Remove MVG detection from magic.mgk due to security risk.

2004-09-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

2004-08-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/t/tiff/write.t: Adjusted file naming.

	* PerlMagick/t/tiff/read.t: Added more tests.

	* coders/tiff.c (ReadTIFFImage): Use ImportImagePixelArea to read
	PseudoClass tiff.
	(WriteTIFFImage): Allow user to set the bits-per-sample define to
	any value in the range of 1 to 32.
	(ReadTIFFImage): Fix endian-reordering for DirectClass read and

	export pixel region using specified QuantumType and
	bits-per-sample.
	(ImportImagePixelArea): New function to import pixel region using
	specified QuantumType and bits-per-sample.

2004-08-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/cache.c (ClonePixelCache): It appeared that cloning a
	disk-based pixel cache was limited to the maximum value of
	size_t. This would result in a truncated cache.  The offset type
	is changed from size_t to magick_off_t in order to avoid this.

	* configure.ac: Check to see if the `char` type is unsigned,
	mostly out of curiosity since the code does not currently make use
	of the result.

	* Fixed many compilation warnings when the compiler warning level
	is set as high as possible.

	* configure.ac: Check /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts for Ghostscript Type1
	fonts.

2004-08-13  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <glennrp@glennrp.com>

	* tEXt and zTXt were inadvertently included in list of unused chunks.

2004-08-09  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <glennrp@glennrp.com>

2004-08-05  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <glennrp@glennrp.com>

	* coders/png.c: Fixes for CERT security alert TA04-217A described
	at "http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA04-217A.html".

2004-08-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.h (Image): Changed type of `colors` and `depth`
	members from type `unsigned long` to `unsigned int`. This change
	is made because on 64-bit CPUs, `unsigned long` is a 64-bit
	type. The depth member is often used in switch statements.  It is
	not recommended to use 64-bit types in switch statements.  The
	maximum number of colors in the colormap is limited to 64K so a
	64-bit type is not required.

2004-08-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (ReadTIFFImage): Restore previous 8/16
	bits-per-sample support code in order to regain lost performance.

	* lcms/src/cmsio1.c: Test [testcms.c] related to lcms 1.13 fail
	with error #12288 when perform "Checking saved linearization
	devicelink".  Fixed function __cmsSaveProfile().  "...malloc(0) is
	implementation dependent and may return non NULL pointer on some
	compilers, like VC++ and gcc. This is not the case of Borland C++
	Builder" - Thanks to Marti Maria that have supplied me this
	patched file: this will be part of the next lcms 1.14 which
	probabily will be released on summer's end.

2004-07-20  Mike Chiarappa  <mikechiarappa@libero.it>

	* lcms/include/lcms.h: Modified to achieve BCBMagick DLL compilation.
	Included modifications was introduced in GM in 2004-01-16 and 
	probabily lost with latest update of library.

2004-07-20  Mike Chiarappa  <mikechiarappa@libero.it>

	* BCBMagick: Updated lcms to version 1.13.
	  + Modified files: BCBMagick\All\bcbMagick.mak; BCBMagick\lcms\BCB6\GM_lcms.bpr;
	    BCBMagick\lcms\BCB6\lcms.bpg; BCBMagick\lcms\BCB6\lcms.bpr;

	source package is obtained from.

2004-07-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Pass essential flags on down to subordinate
	configures when performing `make distcheck`.  Support DESTDIR
	installs for PERL 5.8.1 and later, which support DESTDIR
	internally.

2004-07-16  Mike Chiarappa  <mikechiarappa@libero.it>

	* BCBMagick\coders\libCoders.bpr; BCBMagick\magick\GM_magick.bpr: include
	  file jbig.h could not be found during compilation. Solved.
	
2004-07-15  Mike Chiarappa  <mikechiarappa@libero.it>

	* BCBMagick\magick\magick_config.h.: enabled LZW compression by default.

	* BCBMagick: included jbig delegate library. 
	  + Modified these files into directory BCBMagick: All\bcbMagick.mak;
	    All\GMlib.bpg; All\GMdll.bpg; coders\libCoders.bpr; magick\GM_magick.bpr;
	    utilities\gm_lib.bpr; utilities\gm_dll.bpr

2004-07-09  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* coders/bmp.c (ReadBMPImage): Removed if-test on reading
	red_mask, green_mask, and blue_mask.  These are only *valid*
	under certain conditions, but they are always present in the
	file.

2004-07-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Enable LZW compression by default.

2004-07-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/jpeg.c (WriteJPEGImage): Don't enable Huffman compression
	for large images (> 16 Mpixels for the moment) in order to
	conserve memory.  When Huffman compression is enabled the entire
	image is buffered in memory prior to encoding and writing
	anything.  Huffman compression is a method of eliminating
	redundant data so when the Huffman compression is disabled, files
	sizes will be larger, but otherwise the image is the same.

	* wand/magick_wand.c (MagickSetPassphrase): String was being
	copied to a null pointer.  Now memory is allocated as required
	prior to a copy.
	Ensure that all unimplemented functions return a proper error
	report.

	GMdll.bpr

	* BCBMagick\readme.txt: updated documentation.

2004-06-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImage): For -units, don't reset
	resolution if units are undefined. Report an error if the -units
	argument is not supported.

2004-06-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImage): When setting image units, also
	adjust existing image x_resolution and y_resolution so that
	existing image resolution is not trashed.
	(MogrifyImage): When re-sampling an image, report an error if the
	image does not contain a valid resolution.

2004-06-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	Ghostscript font location for Ghostscript 8.0 and later.

	* GraphicsMagick.spec.in: Install *-config scripts with mode 755
	rather than default 644.

2004-05-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/module.c (InitializeModuleSearchPath): Evaluate and cache
	module search path.
	(FindMagickModule): Use cached module search path.
	(OpenModules): Load all modules rather than just the modules in
	the directory where the LOGO module is found.  Besides allowing
	user-provided modules in non-GraphicsMagick directories to be
	loaded, this allows the "moby" shared build to load additional
	modules via OpenModules.

2004-05-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* utilities/Makefile.am (check): Add convert -list tests.

2004-05-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Magick++ needs to be built as a static library
	under Cygwin and MinGW since C++ exceptions don't work otherwise.
	Be more assertive about that.

	* magick/nt_base.h: Avoid conflict with ssize_t definition under
	MinGW.

2004-05-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Makefile.am: Update to Automake 1.8.5.

	* magick/image.h (ImageInfo): New `progress` monitor to indicate
	if progress monitor and busy cursor are enabled while displaying
	an image.  Defaults to True.

	* magick/display.c, magick/xwindow.c: Use +progress to disable
	progress monitor and busy cursor.

	* magick/command.c (MogrifyUsage): Usage didn't list -operator.
	(ConvertUsage): Usage didn't list -operator.

	* magick/image.c (SetImageOpacity): Ensure that image is
	DirectClass. If specified opacity is TransparentOpacity, then
	replace existing opacity with TransparentOpacity.

2004-04-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Avoid duplicated test status messages for __func__
	tests.  Avoid duplicated test status message for jpeg 6b test.

2004-04-19  Patrick Welche  <prlw1@newn.cam.ac.uk>

	* www/header.html: HTML syntax fixes.

2004-04-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* : Change web pages to a frames-based design.

2004-04-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* utilities/Makefile.am (check): Change geometry arguments which
	were expressed as 0.0xVAL to avoid the problematic Linux scanf
	feature back to 0xVAL.

2004-04-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/symbols.h (GetMagickDimension): Added GetMagickDimension.

2004-04-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/utility.c (GetMagickDimension): New function to replace
	occurances of scanf(geometry,"%lfx%lf",&w,&h) since Linux scanf()
	and strtod() misbehave for strings that start with "0x". The Linux
	versions always treat 0x as the start of a value expressed in hex
	and can't be forced to read the leading value as a double.  This
	function has been applied globally to replace the problem scanf's.	

	* magick/version.h.in: Make it clear in the -version output that a
	mutitude of copyrights and licenses apply to this software.

	* magick/utility.c (GetPathComponent): Avoid strncpy() of
	overlapping regions.

	* magick/command.c (DisplayImageCommand): Eliminate double-free
	of resource_info->image_geometry.
	(DisplayImageCommand): `display` was improperly requiring at least
	one argument (bug was added yesterday).

2004-04-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* utilities/gm.c (main): Default usage message wasn't right for
	aliased utility.

	* configure.ac: Added the --enable-magick-compat option to install
	compatibility links to emulate ImageMagick commands.

	* magick/command.c: Ensure that each sub-command responds to -help
	and -version appropriately.

	* utilities/gm.c (main): Invoke appropriate sub-command if gm is
	executed under a traditional alternate name such as "convert". The
	user may create hard or symbolic links from `gm` to a traditional
	ImageMagick utility name (or just copy `gm` to the desired
	sub-command name) in order to be 100% command-line compatible with
	ImageMagick 5.5.2. This is necessary in order to work with
	existing software designed to execute ImageMagick utilities.

2004-04-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/compress.c (Ascii85Tuple): Encoding bug is indeed fixed
	on DEC Alpha. Also warnings reduction with Digital Unix compiler.

2004-04-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/compress.c (Ascii85Tuple): Add casts to reduce compiler
	warnings, and maybe even fix a bug.

	* coders/pdf.c (ReadPDFImage): Double-check that Ghostscript
	produced an output file since sometimes it reports success after
	it has spewed an error message and has produced no output.

2004-04-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/compress.c (HuffmanEncode2Image): Avoid out of bounds
	array access.

	* magick/studio.h (_FILE_OFFSET_BITS): Fix _FILE_OFFSET_BITS
	#ifdef to avoid warnings when it is not defined.

2004-04-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Fix minor shell syntax error (used ==).

2004-04-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Merged in updates from 1.1 release branch.

	* version.sh (PACKAGE_VERSION): Release version 1.1.
	(PACKAGE_VERSION): Next major release will be 1.1.  Bump library
	versions since we anticipate adding interfaces.

	* magick/studio.h: Disabled use of Windows message lookups
	entirely since this doesn't seem to work for programs.  It
	probably only works for DLLs like ImageMagickObject.

	* magick/delegate.c (ListDelegateInfo): Don't get stuck in a loop
	if fprintf() returns zero.

2004-04-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick/*/*.bat: Add .exe to exe file names in order to
	ensure that the executable is executed rather than something else
	(such as a batch script).

	* magick/locale.c: Only use Windows resource message lookup for
	the DLL build since it doesn't seem to work for static
	executables.

	* magick/utility.c (SetClientPath): Ensure that client path is
	null terminated.
	(SetClientFilename): Initialize default client filename to ""
	rather than "gm.exe" and ensure that filename is null terminated.
	(SetClientName): Ensure that client path is null terminated.

	* magick/blob.c (GetConfigureBlob): Enable logging the load of
	log.mgk

	* magick/log.c: Re-designed logging initialization in order to
	avoid the "chicken and the egg" snafu.  This allows logging the
	initialization of the logging subsystem.

2004-04-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick/bin/log.mgk: Add comments to help document usage.

	* config/log.mgk: Add comments to help document usage.

	* magick/utility.c (IsAccessible): Use access() rather than stat().
	(IsAccessibleNoLogging): Use access() rather than stat().
	(IsDirectory): Implemented return status according to existing API
	documentation.
	(GetExecutionPathUsingName): Complete re-write in order to minimize
	path computation logic and fix failure with partial paths.

2004-03-31  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* doc/options.imdoc: Add "Color" to the arguments available for -list.

2004-03-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh (PACKAGE_CHANGE_DATE): Updated version to 1.1Beta3

	* magick/nt_base.c (NTSystemComman): Have not been successful with using
	MsgWaitForMultipleObjects() reliably, so back out usage of it for
	now.

	* magick/fx.c (ConvolveImage): Support convolution in CMYK
	colorspace.

2004-03-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh (PACKAGE_CHANGE_DATE): Update release to 1.1Beta2.

	* magick/constitute.c (ReadImage): Ignore errors of type
	ConfigureError when loading modules so that error report can still
	report the familiar "No delegate for this image format" message
	while still being able to report problems with loading a module if
	it was found.  This is a compromise which reports useless messages
	when the modules are not found at all, but I can't think of a way
	around it.

	* magick/nt_base.c (NTSystemComman): Adjust
	MsgWaitForMultipleObjects() arguments to wait for object to be
	signaled only (FALSE) rather wait for object to be signaled as
	well as an input event received(TRUE).  It seems that process
	status changes do not result in an input event, so the call was
	deadlocking.

	* magick/constitute.c (ReadImage): If module loading reported an
	error, ReadImage immediately returned an error rather than trying
	to use a delegate defined by delegates.mgk.

2004-03-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh: Updated version to 1.1Beta1

2004-03-24  Mike Chiarappa  <mikechiarappa@libero.it>

	* BCBMagick/magick/libMagick.bpr: updated to latest source modifications.

	* BCBMagick/magick/GM_Magick.bpr: updated to latest source modifications.

2004-03-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/plasma.c (ReadPlasmaImage): srand() is already invoked by
	InitializeMagick() so don't call it here.

	* configure.ac: Check for rand_r().

	* magick/tempfile.c (ComposeTemporaryFileName): The full range of
	safe characters was not being used, thereby limiting the number of
	unique temporary file names available.

2004-03-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (GetImageStatistics): New function to obtain
	image statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, variance, and standard
	deviation).
	(DescribeImage): Include image channel statistics in verbose
	output.

2004-03-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/constitute.c (DispatchImage): Removed some unreachable
	code that was accidentially left in the switch statement.

	* magick/pixel_iterator.c (PixelIterateDualRead): Extended so that
	the region in each image may use a different origin.
	(PixelIterateDualModify): Extended so that
	the region in each image may use a different origin.

	* magick/composite.c (CompositeImage): Fix XorCompositeOp overflow
	condition which occured on non-Intel architectures.

2004-03-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* NEWS: Updated with changes up to today's date.

	* tests/constitute.c (main): Float type seems to require allowing
	a bit of error for Q:32.

	* magick/constitute.c (DispatchImage): Be more careful when
	rounding pixel intensity.
	(ConstituteImage): Be more careful when converting float and
	double to Quantum.

	* magick/composite.c (CompositeImage): Fix Multiply composite
	operator for Q:32 build (was all black image).
	(CompositeImage): Tidied up the documented composite operators so
	the implementation is easier to understand.

	* PerlMagick/t/ttf/read.t: Set a desired label size so output
	image should be the same size as the reference image even if the
	FreeType type hinter is disabled.

	* magick/annotate.c (RenderFreetype): Improve outline bounding box
	computation accuracy.

2004-03-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/t/x/write.t: Don't test X11 if DISPLAY is not set.

	* PerlMagick/t/x/read.t: Don't test X11 if DISPLAY is not set.

2004-03-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/Makefile.am: Removed some apparently unnecessary library
	dependencies.

	* Makefile.am (windows-src): Added a way to generate a Windows
	source zip file.

2004-03-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c: The -operator command now supports
	floating-point and percent of range arguments.

2004-03-15  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c: Added support for -operator command with
	syntax "-operator channel operator rvalue" which applies a
	arithmetic or bitwise operator to a specified image channel
	or all channels.

2004-03-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/t/filter.t: Fix Solarize test case.

	* PerlMagick/t/wmf/read.t: Added another WMF test case.

	* coders/wmf.c: Resolve WMF rendering bug with black color.

	* magick/utility.c (StringToArgv): Free argv data prior to error
	return.

2004-03-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/jpeg.c (WriteJPEGImage): If image_info->colorspace is set
	to GRAYColorspace then make sure that image is in a gray
	colorspace.

	* magick/image.c (TransformRGBImage): If colorspace is already an
	RGB type (RGBColorspace, GRAYColorspace, or TransparentColorspace),
	then simply return.  Do *not* set image->colorspace to RGBColorspace
	since this potentially loses a valuable setting.

2004-03-10  Peter Boos  <pedib@colorfullife.com>

	* magick/annotate.c (RenderFreetype): If DrawAnnotation is called
	with a string containing only one character and this character is
	not recognized by the TrueType engine, a crash occured due to the
	failure of FT_Load_Glyph. The failure caused an uninitialized
	glyph.image pointer to be used by FT_Done_Glyph() later in the
	code. The solution is to initialize the glyph.image pointer to
	null.

2004-03-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (QuantumOperatorRegionImage): Properly handle
	over and underflow of arithmetic operators.

	* magick/draw.c (DrawGetFillOpacity): Use fill opacity, and invert
	opacity range so it is 0.0 to 1.0 (was acting like transparency).
	(DrawSetStrokeOpacity): Validate range of stroke_opacity.
	(DrawSetFillOpacity): Save value to context->fill.opacity and
	validate the range of fill_opacity.

	* magick/image.c (QuantumOperatorImage): New function to apply an
	arithmetic or bitwise operator to the pixel quantums in an image.
	(QuantumOperatorRegionImage): New function to apply an arithmetic
	or bitwise operator to the pixel quantums in an image region.

	* magick/image.c (IsImagesEqual): Re-implemented using the new
	pixel iteration functions as a proof of concept.

	* magick/pixel_iterator.h: Added some pixel iteration functions in
	order to make it easier to implement algorithms which only need to
	iteratively access pixels in a region. These functions are not
	part of the API yet so their interface should be considered
	unstable.

	* doc/GNUmakefile: Rename Makefile to GNUmakefile since it relies
	on GNU make extensions.

2004-03-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/constitute.c (ConstituteImage): Add support for `T`
	(transparency) and `O` (opacity) map types.  Simplify
	implementation.
	(DispatchImage): Add support for `T` (transparency) and `O`
	(opacity) map types.  Simplify implementation.

	* config/delegates.mgk.in: Quote delegate command names so
	that they can contain embedded spaces.

	* VisualMagick/bin/delegates.mgk: Quote delegate command names so
	that they can contain embedded spaces.

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): Use the libtiff default endian
	mode when writing TIFF rather than forcing MSB2LSB bit order.
	(ReadTIFFImage): Enable reading in MSB2LSB bit order (better for
	our byte-level parsing), enable memory mapping, and enable strip
	chopping.  Memory mapping and strip chopping are probably enabled
	by default.

	* magick/nt_base.c (NTSystemComman): Use
	MsgWaitForMultipleObjects() rather than WaitForSingleObject() in
	order to avoid possible deadlock when application code directly or
	indirectly creates windows.

2004-02-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/animate.c (XMagickCommand): URL should point to
	http://graphicsmagick.org/.

	* magick/display.c (XMagickCommand): URL should point to
	http://graphicsmagick.org/.

	* magick/image.c (DisplayImages): Changes to fix memory leaks in
	X11 commands had bugs which seriously broke DisplayImages.  Now
	DisplayImages works properly again.

	* magick/xwindow.c (XDestroyResourceInfo): New function to destroy
	XResourceInfo.

	* coders/x.c (WriteXImage): Implement based on DisplayImages().
	(RegisterXImage): Always register X coder, but with read/write
	support disabled if X11 not available.

2004-02-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (ImportImageCommand): Eliminate memory leaks.

	* magick/memory.c (LiberateMemory): Use MagickFreeMemory macro for
	implementation.
	(ReacquireMemory): Use MagickReallocMemory macro for
	implementation.
	(AcquireMemory): Use MagickAllocateMemory for implementation.

2004-02-26  Vladimir  <lvm@integrum.ru>

	* magick/memory.c (CloneMemory): Fixes to compile under Microsoft
	Visual C++ 6.0.

2004-02-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/animate.c (XAnimateImages): Memory leak reduction and
	better integration with gm command.

	* magick/display.c (XDisplayImage): Display was leaking memory
	like a sieve.  Now it doesn't.

	* magick/memory.c (CloneMemory): Computation for when it is safe
	to use memcpy() was incorrect.  Use memmove() rather than
	backwards-copy loop.

	* Makefile.am ($(DIST_ARCHIVE_SRPM)): Added rules to build a
	source RPM.

	* configure.ac: Search for `buildrpm` or `rpm` programs in order to
	support creating RPM packages on a system which has RPM installed.

	* version.sh (PACKAGE_VERSION): Changed snapshot release naming so
	that there is only one dash in the name and the snapshot date is
	prefixed with `0` to assure proper directory sorting.  This allows
	snapshot naming to be acceptable to RPM.  The snapshot package
	name is now similar to GraphicsMagick-1.1.020040218.tar.bz2

2004-02-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/xwd.c (RegisterXWDImage): Always register XWD, but only
	register read/write methods if it is supported.

	* wand/magick_wand.c: Synchronized with latest ImageMagick API
	changes.

2004-02-16  Lars Ruben Skyum  <lars.skyum@stibo.com>

	* magick/resize.c (HorizontalFilter): Fixed: do process K channel
	for CMYK images.
	(VerticalFilter): do process K channel for CMYK images.
	
2004-02-15  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tga.c (ReadTGAImage): Fix matte channel handling. For
	16-bit packets, use integer rather than floating point. Return
	gray images as PseudoClass and set is_grayscale flag.  Add
	logging.

	* magick/fx.c (WaveImage): Ensure that image is
	DirectClass. Ensure that matte channel is initialized if
	necessary. Include background color in is_grayscale evaluation.

	* magick/gem.c (GenerateNoise): Scale noise to range of quantum.

2004-02-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/jp2.c (WriteJP2Image): Support passing all documented
	Jasper options using -define.

2004-02-13  Peter Boos  <pedib@colorfullife.com>

	* coders/wmf.c (util_draw_arc): Fixes to improve handling for pie,
	arc, and chord.  These fixes produce correct output for
	wmf/examples/fjftest.wmf, but it is not known if they are correct
	for all cases.

2004-02-12  Tim Hunter  <cyclists@nc.rr.com>

	* magick/profile.c (SetImageProfile): Bug fixes.

2004-02-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	C files.

	* magick/constitute.c (MapQuantumType): Fix spurious comma in
	enum definition.

	* configure.ac: Check for Windows fonts under
	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/truetype (XFree86 standard location?).

	* coders/jp2.c (WriteJP2Image): Support providing a compression
	rate value (range 0.0 to 1.0) using command line syntax similar to
	`-define jp2:rate=0.5`.  In Magick++ this option may be accessed
	similar to image.defineValue("jp2","rate","0.5");

	* magick/command.c (DisplayImageCommand): Exit status was inverted
	so `gm display` was returning 1 for successful commands, and 0 for
	failures.
	(AnimateImageCommand): Exit status was inverted so `gm animate`
	was returning 1 for successful commands, and 0 for failures.

2004-02-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/utility.h (MagickReallocMemory): Solaris compiler
	complains about cast so remove it.

	* coders/xwd.c (WriteXWDImage): Right-size the pixels buffer and
	tune writer loops a bit.

	* magick/color.h (VerifyColormapIndex): Improve diagnostics.

	* coders/pict.c (WritePICTImage): Eliminate use of uninitialized
	data when writing RGB PICT. Fix OpenBlob assertion when writing
	JPEG PICT.	
	(ReadPICTImage): Validate `tile_image` colormap indexes rather
	than `image` colormap indexes. Preserve compression attribute from
	tile image.

	* magick/constitute.c (DispatchImage): Don't access image opacity
	channel unless image->matte is True.

2004-02-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c (UnregisterPNGImage): Destroy PNG semaphore.

	* magick/image.c (SetImageInfo): Since we don't know what the
	"IMPLICIT" specifier is supposed to do, support for it is
	removed. Perhaps by removing support for it, we will be reminded
	why it exists.

	* magick/magick.c (DestroyMagickInfo): Invoke
	UnregisterStaticModules().
	(GetMagickInfo): Remove registration for "IMPLICIT" format since
	its purpose is presumed bogus.

	* magick/static.c (UnregisterStaticModules): New function so we
	can unregister static modules.

	* coders/plasma.c (UnregisterPLASMAImage): Unregister FRACTAL.

	* coders/icon.c (UnregisterICONImage): Unregister CUR.

	IPTCTEXT, IPTCWTEXT, and PICON.

	* coders/miff.c: Check for run-length termination before testing
	memory and only check opacity channel if matte is valid.

	* magick/compress.c: Check for run-length termination before
	testing memory (bad read error).

	channel unless matte is enabled.
	(VerticalFilter): Don't process opacity channel unless matte is
	enabled.

	* magick/compress.c (Ascii85Initialize): Don't overwrite an
	existing ascii85 allocation.

	* magick/utility.c (Strip): Use `memmove` rather than `memcpy` to
	copy overlapping data.

	* tests/rwfile.c (main): Fix memory leak in test. Only apply size
	if format requires it.

	* tests/rwblob.c (main): Fix memory leak in test. Only apply size
	if format requires it.

	* coders/mono.c (RegisterMONOImage): Mono is a raw format.

2004-01-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/montage.c (MontageImages): Free thumbnails once they are
	no longer needed (big leak).

	* magick/blob.c (OpenBlob): Ensure that magick array is
	fully initialized, even if the fread() is short.

	* magick/list.c (ImageListToArray): Add a null pointer to the end
	of the image list to serve as a handy list terminator.

	* magick/tempfile.c (DestroyTemporaryFiles): Fix memory leak of
	semaphore.

	* magick/map.c (MagickMapDeallocateMap): Fix memory leak of
	semaphore.

	(DestroyImage): DestroyBlob.

	* coders/wpg.c (ExtractPostscript): Use DestroyBlob.

	* magick/blob.c (DestroyBlob): New function. Similar to
	DestroyBlobInfo except that it requires an Image * argument and
	zeros the blob pointer. This one is preferred for use over
	DestroyBlobInfo.

2004-01-27  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* coders/png.c: Add DestroyBlobInfo() calls to stop memory leak when
	processing JNG datastreams.

2004-01-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	make C++ Happy.

	* coders/tiff.c: Adjust for bitstream API function renaming.

	* magick/bit_stream.h: Rename BitStreamRead() to
	BitStreamMSBRead() to indicate that it reads most significant bytes
	first ("big endian" order).  Rename BitStreamWrite() to
	BitStreamMSBWrite() to indicate that it writes most significant
	bytes first ("big endian" order).

	* wand/magick_wand.c: Updated to lastest ImageMagick API.

2004-01-26  Mike Chiarappa  <mikechiarappa@libero.it>

	* magick/stream.c: (SetPixelStream) removed "const" from definition of 
	local variable [StreamHandler stream]. Borland C++Builder compiler signal
	error "Cannot modify a const object".
	
2004-01-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (TIFFMapBlob): Allow libtiff to access memory
	mapped file (or BLOB in memory) directly.  This provides a small
	performance increase.

	* magick/constitute.c (ReadImage): If a .mpc file is a temporary
	file, then be sure to remove the associated .cache file when
	removing the .mpc file.

	* magick/log.h (LogEventType): ExceptionEventMask now maps to
	WarningEventMask|ErrorEventMask|FatalErrorEventMask so that
	`-debug exception` works again.

	* magick/blob.c (CloseBlob): Allow CloseBlob to be invoked on a
	blob which is not open (in UndefinedStream state).
	(BlobInfo): The definition of BlobInfo is now private to blob.c.
	(StreamType): The StreamType enumeration is now private to blob.c.
	(GetBlobFileHandle): New function to access the blob file handle.
	(GetBlobStreamHandler): New function to access the blob stream
	handler.
	(GetBlobStreamType): This function is removed entirely.
	(BlobIsSeekable): New function to test if SeekBlob will work
	properly for this blob type.
	(GetBlobClosable): New function to test if the blob is allowed to
	be closed by the library (may be an externally provided file
	descriptor).
	(GetBlobTemporary): New function to test if input file is a
	temporary file which is to be removed.
	(SetBlobClosable): New function to support setting the flag which
	keeps the input file from being closed.
	(SetBlobTemporary): New function to support setting the flag which
	indicates that the input file is a temporary file.

	* coders/jpeg.c (ReadJPEGImage): Invoke CloseBlob even if
	blob is in UndefinedStream state.

	* magick/error.h (ThrowReaderException): Ditto.
	(ThrowWriterException): Ditto.
	(ThrowWriterException2): Ditto.
	(ThrowWriterException3): Ditto.

	* magick/tempfile.h (ThrowReaderTemporaryFileException): Ditto.
	(ThrowWriterTemporaryFileException): Ditto.

	* coders/dps.c,coders/jpeg.c, coders/meta.c, coders/mvg.c,
	coders/png.c, coders/tiff.c, magick/constitute.c, magick/stream.c:
	Use new blob accessor functions.

	* magick/cache.c (OpenCache): For Windows, set the sequential
	access flag in all cases.  Maybe it will make a difference.

2004-01-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/blob.c (GetConfigureBlob): Don't check Windows registry
	if MagickLibConfigPath or MagickShareConfigPath is defined.

	* magick/locale.c: Use a Unix-style message database for MinGW.

	* rungm.sh.in: Translate environment paths to Windows format when
	running under MinGW.

	* magick/nt_base.c (mmap): Re-wrote mmap emulation to support
	64-bit file offsets and to support anonymous mapping.
	(msync): A crude emulation of Unix msync().

	* acinclude.m4 (GM_FUNC_MMAP_FILEIO): Change result define from
	HAVE_MMAP to HAVE_MMAP_FILEIO so that it doesn't conflict with
	Autoconf standard definition.

2004-01-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/cache.c (OpenCache): While allocating the pixel cache
	from the heap, reserve enough memory to contain a full PseudoClass
	image in order to reduce the chance that there will be a memory
	allocation failure while processing the image. This also avoids
	the possibility that the image pixels will be block-copied to a
	new location due to heap memory fragmentation. If there is
	insufficient heap memory (malloc() fails), then a disk-based pixel
	cache will be used.

	* coders/wpg.c: Backed out Jaroslav Fojtik's patch from 2004-01-13
	because WPG was failing PerlMagick's existing WPG read test.

2004-01-16  Mike Chiarappa  <mikechiarappa@libero.it>

	* BCBMagick: updated to recent Windows delegate libraries.

	* BCBMagick: modified build procedure. Removed all unused directories
	and include files.

	* lcms/include/lcms.h: Modified to achieve BCBMagick compilation.

	* tiff/libtiff/tiffio.h: Modified to achieve BCBMagick compilation

	* ttf/include/freetype/config/ftoption.h: Modified to achieve
	BCBMagick compilation

	* Magick++/lib/Magick++/Include.h: Modified to achieve BCBMagick compilation.
		
2004-01-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/wpg.c: Applied patch from Jaroslav Fojtik to support
	reading the CTM (current transform matrix).  The CTM is not
	applied yet (expect later patch).

	* wand/wandtest.c: Change MagickCloneWand to MagickGetImage since
	the API name changed.

	* wand/pixel_wand.c: Synchronized with
	latest daily ImageMagick updates.

	* wand/magick_wand.c (MagickRemoveImageProfile): Synchronized with

2004-01-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* wand/magick_wand.c: Ported over the latest ImageMagick Wand API
	updates.  Note that a comment now says that the Wand API will not
	be finished until around 4th quarter of 2004.  This represents a
	1-1/2 year slip from the original estimate!

2004-01-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (IsImagesEqual): Simplified implementation.

	* magick/magick.c: Removed some unused code.

	should fix configure problems under AIX and IRIX.

2004-01-03  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* coders/sgi.c: opacity channel was lost when writing grayscale
	SGI images.  See bug report in magick-users list.
