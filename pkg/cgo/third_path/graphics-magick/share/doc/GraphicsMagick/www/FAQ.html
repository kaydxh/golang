<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">How does GraphicsMagick differ from ImageMagick?</a></h1>
<p><em>GraphicsMagick</em> is originally based on (forked from) ImageMagick
5.5.2 in November 2002, from the version distributed by ImageMagick
Studio LLC, which is itself forked in August 1999 from ImageMagick
developed by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company starting in
1992. Other than utilities being executed as sub-commands of the 'gm'
command, the command-line syntax and programming APIs remain entirely
upward compatible with ImageMagick 5.5.2. A better question might be
&quot;<em>How does ImageMagick differ from ImageMagick?</em>&quot; since ImageMagick
continues to alter and evolve its interfaces so they are no longer
completely compatible with earlier versions. While GraphicsMagick also
adds new features, it does so in a way which assures that existing
features work as they did before. ImageMagick focuses on adding new
functionality and features and has dramatically mutated several times
since the fork.</p>
<p>GraphicsMagick maintains a stable release branch, maintains a detailed
ChangeLog, and maintains a stable source repository with complete version
history so that changes are controlled, and changes between releases are
accurately described. GraphicsMagick provides continued support for a
release branch. ImageMagick does not offer any of these things.</p>
<p>Since GraphicsMagick is more stable, more time has been spent optimizing
and debugging its code.</p>
<p>GraphicsMagick is much smaller than ImageMagick and has dramatically
fewer dependencies on external libraries. For example, on the FreeBSD
operating system, a fully-featured install of GraphicsMagick depends
on 36 libraries whereas ImageMagick requires 64.  GraphicsMagick's
installation footprint is 3-5X smaller than ImageMagick.</p>
<p>GraphicsMagick is usually faster than ImageMagick. The baseline execution
overhead for simple commands is much lower, and GraphicsMagick is also
more efficient at dealing with large images.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-often-does-graphicsmagick-pick-up-new-code-from-imagemagick">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">How often does GraphicsMagick pick up new code from ImageMagick?</a></h1>
<p>GraphicsMagick never picks up new code from ImageMagick as distributed
by ImageMagick Studio LLC. Not long after the GraphicsMagick project
was started in November 2002, ImageMagick from ImageMagick Studio LLC
abandoned the MIT X11 style license it had been using since 1992, and
switched between several different licenses until it ended up with one
based on the Apache license, which is intended to penalize projects
which borrow some of its source code, or fork from it. Since that
time, GraphicsMagick has not incorporated any ImageMagick source code.</p>
<p>On November 27, 2003 ImageMagick Studio LLC applied to register
&quot;ImageMagick&quot; as its trademark, and it was awarded this registered
trademark (serial number 78333969) on August 30, 2005.  Those who
re-distribute modified versions of &quot;ImageMagick&quot; (e.g. patched or
improved) under license as &quot;ImageMagick&quot; now face the risk of
arbitrary trademark infringement claims by ImageMagick Studio LLC.</p>
<p>Authors of new features are encouraged to independently contribute
their work to the GraphicsMagick project so that it can be released
under GraphicsMagick's MIT X11 style license without additional
encumberment.  In order for a work to be accepted, it must have been
developed entirely outside the ImageMagick source base to avoid any
possibility of copyright taint.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="are-there-any-plans-to-use-opencl-or-cuda-to-use-a-gpu">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Are there any plans to use OpenCL or CUDA to use a GPU?</a></h1>
<p>It is well known that some math-intensive algorithms run very quickly
on video-card (and stand-alone) GPUs.  Video card vendors encourage
you to buy an expensive video card with quite a lot of installed RAM
and modify applications to use the GPU via their proprietary or
limited-purpose APIs.  GPUs are quite effective at producing images
for real-time display, such as for video games and virtual reality.
GraphicsMagick has been significantly updated to use multiple CPU
cores to speed up the image processing, and work continues to thread
the few remaining algorithms, or remove inefficiencies in algorithms
which don't see as much speed-up as they should.  Linear speedup as
cores are added is typical for CPU-bound algorithms on well-designed
CPUs.  Regardless, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdal%27s_law">Amdahl's law</a> is a significant factor
in GraphicsMagick, with non-parallelizable code paths often dominating
the time.</p>
<p>It is my belief that stand-alone GPUs are a poor design (expensive,
inefficient, failure-prone, bandwidth bottlenecked, lack
functionality, are insecure, and are not supported in servers) and
that multi-core CPUs will ultimately prevail.  Functionality which
currently works best in a GPU will simply be integrated into
tomorrow's multi-core CPUs and C compilers will naturally support that
functionality.  Once GPU capabilities are integrated into CPUs, there
will be no more need to develop specialized code for a GPU.  Today 16
core CPUs are readily available for purchase in systems at reasonable
prices, and this trend is certain to continue.</p>
<p>Intel's <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon_Phi">Xeon Phi</a> offers a
61 core 'x86 CPU in a GPU-like plugin form-factor which provides over
a TeraFLOP of performance.  Being based on power-hungry plug-in cards,
this solution suffers from many of the issues associated with GPUs.
However, since it supports OpenMP, it may be a suitable target for
executing some GraphicsMagick algorithms. Effective use of Xeon Phi
currently requires use of Intel's development tools so from that
standpoint it is not much more open than GPUs.</p>
<p>Future multi-core CPUs will use a similar amount of power to today's
CPUs, will idle at very low power consumption levels, and will fit
into a very small chassis.  Due to this trend, there is no value
obtained by expending energy toward developing specialized code for
today's GPUs.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-the-meaning-of-magick">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">What is the meaning of &quot;magick&quot;?</a></h1>
<p>According to the infamous British accultist <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>, the definition of
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_(Aleister_Crowley)">magick</a> is
&quot;the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with the
will&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-can-i-process-many-files-at-once">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">How can I process many files at once?</a></h1>
<p>Use 'gm mogrify'.  The 'mogrify' subcommand is designed to operate on
any number of files in one command.  Normally 'mogrify' overwrites the
input files but the <cite>-output-directory</cite> option (which must appear
before any input file names!) allows sending the modified files to a
different directory (which could be in a subdirectory).  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gm mogrify -output-directory .thumbs -resize 320x200 *.jpg
</pre>
<p>If you encounter command line length limitations then you can have
GraphicsMagick expand the file list by quoting the wildcard argument
to prevent it from being expanded by your command shell:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gm mogrify -output-directory .thumbs -resize 320x200 &quot;*.jpg&quot;
</pre>
<p>and you can also retrieve a list of files to process from a text file
(e.g. named 'files.txt') like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gm mogrify -output-directory .thumbs -resize 320x200 &#64;files.txt
</pre>
<p>where files.txt has one line per file name.  If the input file paths
contain relative sub-directory paths (e.g. &quot;foo/file1&quot;, &quot;bar/file2&quot;),
you can instruct GraphicsMagick to create a similar subdirectory
structure under the output directory by adding the
<cite>-create-directories</cite> option:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gm mogrify -output-directory .thumbs -create-directories -resize 320x200 &#64;files.txt
</pre>
<p>Note that the algorithm used to generate output file names is quite
simple.  If -output-directory is &quot;/foo&quot; and the file path is
&quot;bar/none.jpg&quot; then the final path will be &quot;foo/bar/none.jpg&quot;.  Based
on this it should be clear that when <cite>-output-directory</cite> is used, file
paths should be relative paths rather than absolute paths or else the
concatenation won't work.</p>

<p><em>GraphicsMagick</em> uses several freely available packages to perform the
translation of certain image formats (<em>PostScript</em>, <em>MPEG</em>, etc.). Make
sure these packages are available as described in the <a class="reference external" href="README.html">README</a> file. Also
verify that you have plenty of temporary disk space. If not, set the
MAGICK_TMPDIR (or TMPDIR) environment variable to an area where
sufficient space is available. Finally, for <em>PostScript</em>, verify that
Ghostscript supports the <em>pnmraw</em> or <em>ppmraw</em> device (<tt class="docutils literal">gs <span class="pre">-h</span></tt>) and that
the document contains valid <em>PostScript</em> statements (<tt class="docutils literal">gs image.ps</tt>).</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">How do I set the transparency index in a GIF image so it displays properly within Mozilla?</a></h1>
<p>Display your GIF image with <a class="reference external" href="display.html">display</a>. Choose <em>Matte</em> from the <em>Image
Edit</em> command menu and identify a pixel that has the <em>transparency</em>
color. Press <em>Method</em> and select a matte edit method from a pop-up menu.
Choose from these methods:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>point</li>
<li>replace</li>
<li>floodfill</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>point</em> method changes the matte value of any pixel selected with the
pointer until the button is is released. The <em>replace</em> method changes the
matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the pixel you select
with a button press. <em>Floodfill</em> changes the matte value of any pixel
that matches the color of the pixel you select with a button press and is
a neighbor.</p>
<p>Select your transparent pixel with the pointer and press a button. The
image is redisplayed with any transparent pixels recolored to the
background color. You can select other pixels or areas to force to
transparent. When you are satisfied, press Return.</p>
<p>Finally, choose <em>Save</em> from the command menu and write your GIF image to
a file. <strong>Note that setting transparency works best on a TrueColor or
DirectColor visual</strong>. If your server only exports colormapped visuals you
will need to use a <em>Standard Colormap</em> to set transparency.</p>

it may not always have the correct colors in some areas. This can happen
when a subwindow has a different colormap than its parent. With
<em>-descend</em>, <a class="reference external" href="import.html">import</a> descends the window hierarchy. Descending involves
grabbing the image and colormap of each window or subwindow associated

<div class="section" id="i-get-a-memory-allocation-error-what-can-i-do">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">I get a memory allocation error. What can I do?</a></h1>
<p>Memory allocation is a complex topic in GraphicsMagick and image
processing requires a lot of memory. GraphicsMagick tries to take best
advantage of the resources available by optimizing its use of <em>virtual</em>
memory. Virtual memory is normally the amount of RAM (Random Access
Memory) available to the process plus the amount of free space in the
system paging area (known as &quot;swap&quot; under Unix, or a &quot;page file&quot; under
Windows). In addition to the RAM and the paging area, GraphicsMagick is
able to expand the amount of virtual memory available by using
memory-mapped files which cause the file to be treated as extra memory. A
piece of hardware known as the Memory Management Unit (MMU) performs the
magic which allows the system paging area and memory-mapped files to be
treated as more memory by your system's CPU.</p>
<p>Usually when a memory allocation error occurs, it is because the system's
paging area is full, or the programs memory (heap) is fragmented badly
enough that there is no large-enough block of memory available to satisfy
the request. In some cases the operating system may artificially limit
the memory available to the program. Failures of small memory allocations
are generally considered fatal by GraphicsMagick. If it is impossible to
allocate even a little bit of memory, then there is no point in
continuing. When large memory allocations associated with allocating
memory for image pixels fail, GraphicsMagick uses that as a key to know
that it should start using memory-mapped temporary files to increase
virtual memory. Under Unix and other POSIX-compliant systems, these
memory-mapped temporary files are created in either the system default
location (e.g. <cite>/var/tmp</cite>) or the directory set by the TMPDIR environment
variable. Under Windows, temporary files are created in the directory set
by the TEMP or TMP environment variable. Use the MAGICK_TMPDIR
environment variable to specify a directory for GraphicsMagick to write
its temporary files.</p>
<p>If the temporary file directory is too small, or is itself mapped to the
system's paging area (no win!), then GraphicsMagick will fail to allocate
more virtual memory via the temporary file and will return an error.</p>
<p>The single biggest factor in how much memory is required by
GraphicsMagick is the QuantumDepth setting when it was compiled. The
amount of memory (in bytes) required to store a single image in memory is
may be calculated via the equation (QuantumDepth*Rows*Columns*5)/8. As a
means of example, the following table shows the amount of memory consumed
by a single 1024x768 image using the supported QuantumDepth settings:</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="46%" />
<col width="54%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr><th class="head">QuantumDepth</th>
<th class="head">Virtual Memory</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>8</td>
<td>3MB</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>16</td>
<td>8MB</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>32</td>
<td>15MB</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>Performing an image processing operation may require that several images
be in memory at one time. In the case of animations, hundreds of images
may be in memory at one time.</p>
<p><em>GraphicsMagick</em> is designed to be general purpose. It can display many
image storage formats (<em>Monochrome</em>, <em>PseudoColor</em>, or <em>TrueColor</em>) on
many different types of X visuals (<em>StaticGray, StaticColor, PseudoColor,
GrayScale, DirectColor,</em> or <em>TrueColor</em>). To support all these
combinations of image storage formats and X visuals, extra memory is
required. Additionally, <a class="reference external" href="animate.html">animate</a> and <a class="reference external" href="montage.html">montage</a> store an entire image
sequence in memory.</p>
<p>It is recommended that systems used to run <em>GraphicsMagick</em> have at least
96MB of RAM and 140MB free in their paging area. Systems used to process
large images (do the math!) may require considerably more memory to
operate efficiently. GraphicsMagick is proven to be far more efficient at
processing huge images when it is compiled as a 64-bit application on a
64-bit capable CPU. RAM is typically 1000 times faster than disk, so it
is important to keep as much data in RAM as possible (buy lots of RAM).
The temporary file area should have plenty of free space. The size of the
temporary file area is usually the deciding factor as to whether
GraphicsMagick is able to complete an operation. With sufficient free
disk space, GraphicsMagick is primarily limited by your CPU, your

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">What are visual image directories? How do I use them?</a></h1>
<p>A visual image directory (VID) is an image that contains thumbnails of
one or more images in a file directory. Rather than displaying each
individual image at its full resolution, you can browse the visual image
directory and choose an image to display. You can create a VID with
either of these commands:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gm montage *.jpg directory.vid
gm convert 'vid:*.jpg' directory.vid
</pre>
<p>Of course you can substitute any filenames you desire. <a class="reference external" href="montage.html">Montage</a> has many
relevant command line options. You can exercise more control over the
appearance of the VID than with <a class="reference external" href="convert.html">convert</a>.</p>
<p>Next display the directory:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gm display directory.vid
</pre>
<p>Finally browse and select an image to display. Move the pointer to the
image and press button 3.</p>
<p>You can create the VID directory with this command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gm display 'vid:*.jpg'
</pre>
<p>You can also select <em>Visual Image...</em> from the <em>File</em> menu of the command
widget.</p>
<p><em>Note, that creating a VID is time consuming</em>. Creating them on-the-fly
within <a class="reference external" href="display.html">display</a> may be less convenient than using <a class="reference external" href="montage.html">montage</a> or <a class="reference external" href="convert.html">convert</a> .
Also, if you create them with <a class="reference external" href="montage.html">montage</a>. or <a class="reference external" href="convert.html">convert</a>, you can reuse them
as often as necessary.</p>
<p>Note that a visual image directory is useful for looking at individual
frames of an image sequence:</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="first">Surround the image with a border of color</p>
<p>Use -border followed by the width and height of the border. Set the
color of the border with -bordercolor. For example, to surround your
image with a red border that is 25 pixels wide on each side, use</p>

</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Surround the image with an ornamental frame</p>
<p>Use -frame followed by the width and height of the frame. Set the

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">How can I make Postscript text look good?</a></h1>
<p>Simple. Increase the dots-per-inch when converting and sub-sample:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gm convert -density 288 -geometry 25% image.ps image.gif
</pre>
<p>Change the density to 144 and geometry to 50% if the above command fails
due to insufficient memory. Alternatively, see the Ghostscript
documentation about using high-quality fonts.</p>
<p>The -density option increases the number of pixels (or dots) generated by
Ghostscript when processing the input postscript file. However as all
other images formats are generally displayed on screens which are
typically about 72 to 100 dots per inch, the output image will be larger.</p>
<p>The <em>-geometry</em> option reduces the large image output of ghostscript
image back to a normal 72 dpi resolution (25% of 288 dpi gives 72 dpi)
but in the process anti-aliases (or smooths) the fonts and lines of the
image so as to remove the jaggies you would otherwise get from a normal
postscript to image conversion.</p>

<p>Or if you are using <a class="reference external" href="display.html">display</a>, use the font pattern above within the Font
Browser (see Image Edit-&gt;Annotate). Next substitute the appropriate
resolution. Keep in mind that a scalable font must be fully qualified to
work. That is, all 14 fields must be specified. Here is one example where
we annotate an image with large <em>Helvetica</em> text:</p>

<p>GraphicsMagick 1.2.2 and later support combining multiple channels in of

starting with a CMYK JPEG file, we can create a set of separate files
with one file per channel:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gm convert cmyk.jpg -channel cyan cyan.tiff
gm convert cmyk.jpg -channel magenta magenta.tiff
gm convert cmyk.jpg -channel yellow yellow.tiff
gm convert cmyk.jpg -channel black black.tiff

<p>and then we can join them back together:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gm composite -compose CopyMagenta magenta.tiff cyan.tiff result.tiff
gm composite -compose CopyYellow yellow.tiff result.tiff result.tiff
gm composite -compose CopyBlack black.tiff result.tiff result.tiff

<p>Perhaps it is possible to accomplish this in one composite command. We
will leave that as an exercise for later. Note that it is possible to
extract just one channel, manipulate it, and then insert it back into the
original image file.</p>
<p>There is also built-in support for a <em>Partition</em> interlace format which

<div class="section" id="what-does-identify-report">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id34">What does <cite>identify</cite> report?</a></h1>
<p>GraphicsMagick is sophisticated image handling software supporting
perhaps a hundred formats, and hundreds of subformats, yet it needs to
be able to apply image processing algorithms in a consistent way, and
save to many output formats.  Some image types are radically different
from others.  Due to this, GraphicsMagick normalizes images it reads
into only nine internal in-memory formats (see the description of
-type) which are a specialization of just two internal formats.  The
<cite>identify</cite> command reports the characteristics of one of those
internal formats rather than the genuine properties of the input image
file.  In fact, if the properties of all the input files were to be
reported, it would require a book to describe all of the properties.
For example, the WMF vector-drawing format is much different from the
PNG image file format, yet GraphicsMagick can read both.</p>
<p>Only limited original properties are preserved, and it depends on how
GraphicsMagick was built.  For example, a &quot;Q8&quot; build can only report
up to a depth of 8 bits, but a &quot;Q32&quot; build can report a depth of up to
32 bits.  The original image depth is reported if it is at least 8
bits, and equal to or less than the build depth.</p>
<p>By default <cite>identify</cite> reports only the most basic properties:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% gm identify seaworld.jpg
seaworld.jpg JPEG 1530x1020+0+0 DirectClass 8-bit 204.0K 0.000u 0:01
</pre>
<p>but with -verbose it can report on a large number of properties.</p>
