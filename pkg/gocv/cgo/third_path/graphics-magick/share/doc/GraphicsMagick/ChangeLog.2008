2008-12-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick/installer/inc/body.isx: They say that when in Rome
	you should do as the Roman's do.  Based on this philosophy, all of
	the coder and filter DLLs are now installed to the same directory
	as the executables and DLLs which depend on them.  This eases
	operation under Windows Vista.

2008-12-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	and 24 bit short floats.  Relies on code developed for
	GraphicsMagick by Richard Nolde.
	(ImportViewPixelArea): Support importing 16 and 24 bit short
	floats.  Relies on code developed for GraphicsMagick by Richard
	Nolde.

2008-12-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/operator.h (enum QuantumOperator): Added LogQuantumOp,
	MaxQuantumOp, MinQuantumOp, and PowQuantumOp enumerations as well
	as "Log", "Max", "Min", and "Pow" options to -operator.

2008-12-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImage): The -write option was not
	implemented in a useful fashion and the +write option never worked
	at all.  Re-implement -write and eliminate +write from the
	documentation since +write is not needed.

2008-12-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (ReadTIFFImage, WriteTIFFImage) Support reading
	and writing 64-bit integer TIFF.

	* coders/tiff.c (ReadTIFFImage): Fix bug with reading one bit per
	sample RGB images.

2008-12-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (OpenCache): Fix a code ordering problem
	which results in `identify` throwing an assertion for PseudoClass
	image files.  This bug was added in the 1.3.2 release.

	* coders/tiff.c (ReadTIFFImage): Fix bug with `ping` mode.

2008-12-07  Fojtik Jaroslav  <JaFojtik@seznam.cz>

	* coders/fits.c: Proper signed to unsigned conversion for 64 bit LSB images.

2008-12-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/Makefile.am: When X11 is disabled, don't compile the
	X11-specific source modules.  Don't ever install any X11-related
	header files.

2008-12-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/segment.c (SegmentImage): Use `double` rather than 64-bit
	integer to accumulate totalized values.  Make the cluster summary
	report more concise.

2008-12-06  Fojtik Jaroslav  <JaFojtik@seznam.cz>

	* coders/fits.c: Fix for 64 bit images.

2008-12-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/segment.c (SegmentImage): Cluster threshold is expressed
	as a percentage of total cluster pixels.  Optimize for larger
	images.

2008-12-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/segment.c (SegmentImage): Accelerate using OpenMP.

2008-11-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/utility.c (ExpandFilenames): Remove some arbitrary
	argument length limits.  Pass -convolve argument without any
	additional checking.  Verify that strings are not truncated during
	copy.
	(ListFiles): Be more memory efficient.

	* magick/fx.c (ConvolveImage): Fix formatting problem when logging
	the convolution kernel used.

	* magick/utility.c (TranslateTextEx): Support formatting huge
	comment text.

2008-11-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/fx.c (ConvolveImage): Don`t process opacity channel
	unless image has one.

	* magick/effect.c (MotionBlurImage): Use
	AcquireOnePixelByReference() rather than AcquireImagePixels() to
	retrieve one pixel.  This is much more efficient.
	(AdaptiveThresholdImage): Don`t process opacity channel unless
	image has one.
	(BlurImage): Don`t process opacity channel unless image has one.

2008-11-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/profile.c (ProfileImage): +profile now supports a simple
	exclusion syntax.  For example, to strip all of the profiles
	except for the ICM profile use +profile '!icm,*'.  The new syntax
	also allows multiple profile names to be listed at once.  The
	primary requirement is that all excluded profiles must be listed
	prior to those to be stripped.

2008-11-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/transform.c (RollImage): Remove image storage class
	alteration.
	(CompositeImageRegion): Ensure that the canvas image storage class
	is correct.

2008-11-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* config/delegates.mgk.in: Since we removed support for `spawn` a
	long time ago, and no longer execute using the Unix shell by
	default, we need to add an ampersand to the end of the two entries
	previously using `spawn` so that the display program does not hang
	when it invokes the external program.

	* utilities/Makefile.am (UTILITIES_TESTS): Add preview-based
	tests.

	* coders/preview.c (WritePreviewImage): Solarize requires a
	threshold argument.

	* coders/vid.c (WriteVIDImage): Eliminate memory leak.

	* magick/montage.c (MontageImages): Fix continued use of freed
	memory.

2008-11-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	NormalizeImage() now share one common function for generating the
	histogram.

	* magick/enhance.c (ModulateImage): Improve performance a bit.
	(ContrastImage): Improve performance a bit.
	(GammaImage): Improve performance a bit.

2008-11-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/authors.rst: List Mark Mitchell as an author.

	* utilities/tests/msl_composite.sh: Fix `rm -f` without a valid
	argument which annoyed NetBSD.

	* coders/fits.c: Impose a limit on the length of the row PDU.
	Make sure that GraphicsMagick version information does not
	overflow the length allowed by a row PDU.

2008-11-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/jpeg.c (WriteJPEGImage): Use DCT algorithm default from
	the library rather than the header file.

	* magick: Adjust OpenMP scheduling options based on observed
	behavior.

2008-11-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/shear.c (IntegralRotateImage): Added OpenMP acceleration
	for rotate by 90 and 270 degrees.

	* configure.ac: New --disable-openmp-slow configure for disabling
	use of OpenMP for algorithms which may run slower on operating
	systems with crummy thread libraries.  This still allows gaining
	the benefits from OpenMP for CPU hogs.  Verified to help with
	FreeBSD 7.0 and Apple OS-X Leopard.

	* magick/semaphore.c: Trimmed out the debug code in order to
	obtain a bit more performance.

2008-11-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/jpeg.c: Allow the user to specify the DCT method
	(jpeg:dct-method), or if huffman encoding should be enabled
	(jpeg:optimize-coding=true).  Default the DCT method to the
	libjpeg default rather than forcing it to JDCT_FLOAT since float
	is slower on some systems.

2008-11-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/jp2.c (BlobClose): Leak a little bit less memory when
	reading a JP2 file.

2008-11-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* wand/wandtest.c: Eliminate memory leak.

	* wand/drawing_wand.c (DestroyDrawingWand): Eliminate memory
	leaks.

	* coders/xwd.c (WriteXWDImage): Force colormapped images with more
	than 256 colors to DirectClass.

	* magick/enhance.c (ModulateImage): Improve progress message.

	* coders/msl.c: Eliminate memory leaks.

	* GraphicsMagick.spec.in: Apply RPM spec file fixes from Giacomo
	Tenaglia for Red Hat Linux 4.

2008-11-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/msl.c: Fix bug with attributes becoming appended to
	themselves.  Resolves SF issue 2255754. Reflowed code.

2008-11-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh: GraphicsMagick 1.3 released.
	Next release on head will be 1.4.

	* www/OpenMP.rst: Updated with latest measurement data.

	* www/benchmarks.rst: Updated with latest benchmark data.

	* coders/url.c (RegisterURLImage): Register HTTP and FTP URL
	support in the "unstable" category since these are capable of
	accessing the network and therefore represent a potential security
	issue.  Register the FILE URL support in the "stable" category
	since it is capable of incorporating local disk files, which may
	still represent a security security issue for server applications.
	Note that disabling these functions might cause some existing MSL,
	MVG and SVG scripts to stop working if they use external URLs.

2008-11-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/pnm.c (ReadPNMImage): Sequential multi-thread the PNM raw
	format readers. Can improve read performance quite substantially
	for large PBM and PGM files, and less so for PPM.  There is most
	benefit for systems with more I/O than one CPU core will support.
	Systems with slow I/O and a relatively fast CPU may see somewhat
	diminished read performance with more CPU consumption.  As such,
	this is effectively a verification that multi-threading the reader
	is possible, and may be of benefit to power-users.

	* magick/omp_data_view.c (AllocateThreadViewDataArray): New
	function to allocate a thread view data array.  Updated modules
	using similar code to use this function in order eliminate
	useless redundancy.

2008-11-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/pixel_cache.c: Incorporate OMP thread views into the
	pixel cache so usage is less invasive.  Update OMP-enhanced source
	modules to suit.
	(GetImagePixelsEx): New function similar to GetImagePixels()
	except that it reports exceptions to a user-provided structure.
	(SetImagePixelsEx): New function similar to SetImagePixels()
	except that it reports exceptions to a user-provided structure.
	(SyncImagePixelsEx): New function similar to SyncImagePixels()
	except that it reports exceptions to a user-provided structure.
	(AccessImmutableIndexes): New function to access read-only
	colormap indexes.
	(AccessMutableIndexes): New function to access writeable colormap
	indexes.
	(AccessMutablePixels): New function to access writeable pixels.
	(AccessDefaultCacheView): New function to access the default cache
	view.

2008-11-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (BenchmarkImageCommand): With no other
	arguments, the benchmark command now defaults to one iteration.

	* magick/effect.c (SpreadImage): Offsets array size is a prime
	number to help avoid beating.
	(SpreadImage): Ensure that spread loops are always terminal.

	* magick/utility.c (MagickRandReentrant): Fix bug where rand() was
	being continually re-seeded if rand_r() was not available.

2008-11-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* utilities/tests/msl_composite.sh: Replace SVG image generation
	with simpler approach which properly centers the text.  Use our
	own font so that tests will pass if the user does not have fonts
	installed.

	* magick/utility.c (GetMagickDimension): Extend to support parsing
	optional x and y offset values and use to fix parsing for
	-oil-paint and -unsharp when sscanf() is C'99 compliant.

2008-11-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/pixel_cache.h (AcquireOneCacheViewPixel): Pass pixel to
	update by reference.
	(AcquireOnePixelByReference): New private inline method which
	passes pixel to update by reference.

	* magick/omp_thread_view.h (AcquireOneThreadViewPixel): Pass pixel
	to update by reference.

	* magick/alpha_composite.h (BlendCompositePixel): Replace
	BlendComposite with BlendCompositePixel, which passes the
	composite pixel by reference.
	(AlphaCompositePixel): Replace AlphaComposite with
	AlphaCompositePixel, which passes the composite pixel by
	reference.
	(AtopCompositePixel): Replace AtopComposite with
	AtopCompositePixel, which passes the composite pixel by reference.

	* configure.ac: With excessive maintenance releases, the library
	age portion of MAGICK_LIB_VERSION was overflowing its allotted
	space.  This resulted in 1.1.X releases reporting the wrong
	MagickLibVersion as of 1.1.10.  Fix this by supporting up to 99
	values for each field.

2008-11-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Fix passing the --with-windows-font-dir option via
	DISTCHECK_CONFIG_FLAGS.

	* utilities/tests/msl_composite.sh: Integrated MSL composition
	test script contributed by Max Hohenegger, Max at hohenegger.eu.

	* magick/command.c (ConjureImageCommand): Return status was
	inverted so one was returned for command success rather than zero.

2008-11-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* png: Updated libpng to 1.2.33 release.

	* magick/color.c (FuzzyColorMatch): If fuzz is zero then
	completely use the result of ColorMatch() rather than entering
	unnecessary expensive code.

2008-10-31  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/studio.h: Make sure we don't conflict with OpenMP
	implementation if it is active but we are not using it.

2008-10-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/studio.h (HAVE_OPENMP): Add logic to make sure that
	OpenMP is only engaged for OpenMP 2.0 or later.

	* magick/command.c (VersionCommand): Report OpenMP version.

	* Makefile.am: The Magick++ build was supposed to be optional. Now
	it is.

	* Makefile.am: Eliminated .tar.bz2 and .zip packages from the
	distribution.  The .tar.bz2 package was hardly smaller than the
	.tar.gz package so it wasted 5.9MB with little benefit.  The
	compression ratio on the .zip archives is absolutely terrible so
	eliminating zip eliminates huge 9.6MB and 25MB files from the
	distribution equation.  Windows users can easily learn how to use
	the vastly more efficient 7-Zip format.

2008-10-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Rationalize OpenMP tests to make sure that OpenMP
	can not be enabled without thread support.

2008-10-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/composite.c (CompositeImageRegion): Add some minimal

	* magick/transform.c (RollImage): Accellerate using OpenMP.

2008-10-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/studio.h (omp_get_thread_num): Remove spurious trailing
	`;`.

	* magick/render.c (DrawPrimitive): Make method private since
	nothing else is using it.

	* magick/omp_thread_view.h (AccessThreadView): Inline function for
	a bit more performance.
	(AcquireOneThreadViewPixel) Inline function for a bit more
	performance.

2008-10-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* pragma omp parallel for: Use consistent static scheduling
	throughout and ensure that 64 threads can be usefully engaged on a
	1024 row image.

	* magick/pixel_iterator.c (SetRegionThreads): Implement logic so
	that pixel iterators execute single-threaded when invoked on tiny
	regions.

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (SetNexus): Make staging buffer memset()
	conditional in order to dramatically diminish impact to small
	accesses.  This memset() only exists to make valgrind happy.

2008-10-24  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (ReadTIFFImage): Fix progress monitor for the case
	of reading planar stripped images.

	implementation.

	* magick/effect.c (MedianFilterImage): Accelerate using OpenMP.
	(ReduceNoiseImage): Accelerate using OpenMP.

2008-10-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/fx.c (WaveImage): Accelerate using OpenMP.
	(SwirlImage): Accelerate using OpenMP.
	(ImplodeImage): Accelerate using OpenMP.

2008-10-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (GetCacheViewRegion): New function to
	return the region bounded by a pixel cache view.

	cache view pixels.

2008-10-19  Fojtik Jaroslav  <JaFojtik@seznam.cz>

	* coders/fits.c: Remove unused exponential data.

2008-10-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/omp_thread_view.c: Move OMP Thread View functions out of
	pixel cache module and put them in this new module.

	* coders/xtrn.c (ReadXTRNImage): XTRNSTREAM mode was never
	implemented so remove unfinished stub code.

2008-10-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (SetImageDepth): Needed to assign image depth
	attribute to user-specified depth rather than only altering the
	pixels.
	(SetImageOpacity): Reimplement using pixel iterators.
	(AverageImages): Accelerate using OpenMP.

	row count is updated.

	* coders/fits.c (ReadFITSImage): Update to use
	MagickFindRawImageMinMax().
	(WriteFITSImage): Expand buffer size to MaxTextExtent.  Include
	GraphicsMagick version in FITS header.

	function to assist with finding the minimum and maximum data of
	raw image files.

2008-10-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (AcquireThreadViewPixels): Convert thread
	set view convenience methods into library methods because the
	inline methods were causing the Sun Studio compiler to produce
	thread unsafe code.  Due to likely beneficial inlining in the
	library, this is not expected to cause any performance impact.

2008-10-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/t/filter.t: Add a test for UnsharpMask.

	* magick/effect.c (UnsharpMaskImage): Use Blur rather than

2008-10-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/monitor.c (MagickMonitorFormatted): New method to support
	issuing a formatted progress monitor message.  Use it throughout
	so that file name is included in progress indication.

2008-10-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Bootstrap with autoconf 2.63.  Require autoconf
	2.62 to bootstrap.

2008-10-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www: Adopted improved web page design by Mark Mitchell.

2008-10-04  Fojtik Jaroslav  <JaFojtik@seznam.cz>

	* coders/fits.c coders/mat.c Used a same piece of code to calculate
	min and max data value.

2008-09-30  Fojtik Jaroslav  <JaFojtik@seznam.cz>

	* coders/fits.c Fixed 16 bit fits writer that wrote wrongly
	shaped unsigned ints.

2008-09-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* doc/conjure.imdoc: Applied patches from Max at hohenegger.eu to
	mention previously undocumented elements and to provide a
	composition example.

2008-09-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/shear.c (IntegralRotateImage): Accelerate rotation by 0
	and 180 degrees using OpenMP.
	(XShearImage): Accellerate using OpenMP (accellerates -rotate and
	-shear).

	* magick/pixel_cache.c: Exhuastive study of the pixel cache code
	reveals that it is inscrutable and not implemented in a fashion
	which enables useful multi-threading.  Therefore, the cache view
	interfaces are now made OpenMP-safe via a global critical section.

2008-09-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/pixel_iterator.c: Reduce use of critical sections around

	* wand/magick_wand.c (MagickCompareImageChannels): Use
	DifferenceImage().
	(MagickCompareImages): Implement by calling
	MagickCompareImageChannels().

	* magick/compare.c (DifferenceImage): The ImageMagick-compatible
	CompareImages() function signature was clearly an example of bad
	design so rename CompareImages() to DifferenceImage() with a

	* coders/dcm.c (ReadDCMImage): Report actual image depth.

	* magick/resource.c (InitializeMagickResources): Set default

	The default limit is added since it is observed that the Group4
	compressor fails with extremely huge strips.  Added a define
	"tiff:rows-per-strip" to allow the user to explicitly set the rows
	per strip.  Added a define "tiff:strip-per-page=true" to allow the
	user to force one strip per page no matter what.  Added progress
	monitor support to tile writer.

2008-06-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/gem.c (GenerateNoise): Poisson noise generation was
	taking excessively long and producing wrong results.  Noise
	generation was only producing the correct amount of noise in the
	Q8 build.

	floating-point differential format.

2008-06-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	part and check for EOF so that bogus files are rejected quickly.

	* coders/cineon.c (ReadCINEONImage): Incrementally read user data
	part and check for EOF so that bogus files are rejected quickly.

2008-05-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/pict.c (ReadPICTImage): Ensure that row_bytes calculation
	does not overflow.  Verify that RLE decode does not overflow
	buffer.  Validate image frame dimensions.	

	* coders/palm.c (ReadPALMImage): Validate PALM bits per pixel and

	channels to individual files.

2008-05-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/fx.c (ConvolveImage): Eliminate unnecessary "range check"
	feature since range checking is not where the CPU time is going.

	* magick/effect.c (UnsharpMaskImage): Re-write implementation to
	use pixel iterators.

	* magick/pixel_iterator.c: Decided that the old per-pixel
	iterations were not useful enough to keep since the region-based
	ones are working fine.  Moved pixel_row_iterator.c to
	pixel_iterator.c and renamed functions to remove the `Row`
	designation.

	* magick/composite.c (CompositeImage): Automatically adjust
	colorspace of composite image so that it is compatible with canvas
	image.

	* magick/alpha_composite.h (AlphaComposite): Fix alpha composite
	when both pixels contain transparency.

	* PerlMagick/demo/demo.pl: Use segmentation parameters which
	are more suitable for our image.

2008-05-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/composite.c (CompositeImage): CMYK copy composition
	operators automatically set the image colorspace to CMYK.

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): CMYK must take precedence over
	JPEG compression.  We don't support JPEG compression in TIFF with
	CMYK.

2008-05-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/effect.c (ChannelThresholdImage): Re-implement using
	pixel iterators.  Support thresholding only the red channel by
	eliminating the switch to intensity thresholding if only one
	channel parameter is supplied.

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): Don't accidentially convert CMYK
	images to RGB.

	* magick/composite.c (CompositePixels): Handle CopyBlack properly
	for CMYK images.

	* magick/command.c (CompositeImageCommand):  Support CopyCyan,
	CopyMagenta, CopyYellow, and CopyBlack.

	* magick/composite.c (CompositeImage): Preserve the canvas image
	colorspace.

	* doc/options.imdoc: Remove mention of thresholding at the channel
	level since this never worked in a useful fashion and now only
	simple intensity thresholding is available via -threshold.

	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImage): Revert to using ThresholdImage() rather
	than ChannelThresholdImage().

	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Revert to using ThresholdImage() rather
	than ChannelThresholdImage().

2008-05-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/effect.c (AddNoiseImage): Implemented using pixel
	iterators.

	* magick/pixel_row_iterator.c (PixelRowIterateDualNew): New pixel
	iterator.  Similar to existing PixelRowIterateDualModify except
	that this one is for when initializing a new image.

2008-05-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/composite.c (CompositeImage): Update image composition to
	use pixel iterator methods.

2008-05-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/enhance.c: Re-wrote all enhancement functions in this
	module to be based on the pixel iterator methods.

	* magick/command.c (ConvertImageCommand, MogrifyImageCommand,
	DisplayImageCommand): Gamma multiple channel syntax was broken.
	Now it is fixed.

2008-05-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/colorspace.c (RGBTransformImage): Optimized lookup table
	generation performance to the maximum extent possible.
	(TransformRGBImage): Optimized lookup table
	generation performance to the maximum extent possible.

	* magick/image.h (RoundDoubleToQuantum): New macro to explicitly
	safely round a `double` to a Quantum.
	(RoundFloatToQuantum): New macro to explicitly safely round a

	flag for CopyOpacity composition.

	* magick/composite.c (CompositeImage): CopyOpacity composition
	needs the opacity channel to be enabled.

	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Dissolve composition with Opacity was not
	working right.  Now it does.

2008-05-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/gem.c (HWBTransform): Hue value range was scaled wrong,
	leading to clipping.
	(TransformHWB): Hue value range was scaled wrong, leading to
	clipping.

2008-05-15  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/colorspace.c (RGBTransformImage): Re-implement transform
	loops using PixelRowIterateMonoModify() in order to simplify the
	code.

2008-05-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/colorspace.c (TransformRGBImage): Re-implement transform
	loops using PixelRowIterateMonoModify() in order to simplify the
	code.

	* magick/{pixel_iterator.h, pixel_row_iterator.h}: Pass pixel
	colormap index/indexes to callback functions.  Dependent code is
	adjusted to match.

	ThresholdWhiteQuantumOp.

2008-05-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (VersionCommand): Report if OpenMP is supported
	by the build.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: Install documentation according to
	the conventions established by the configure script.  This
	installs the documentation under
	/usr/local/share/doc/GraphicsMagick by default.

2008-05-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* scripts/format_c_api_docs: Add pixel_iterator.c and
	pixel_row_iterator.c to API documentation formatter.

	* magick/api.h: Include pixel_iterator.h and pixel_row_iterator.h.

	* magick/Makefile.am (MAGICK_INCLUDE_HDRS): Formally install
	pixel_iterator.h and pixel_row_iterator.h.

	* magick/image.c (IsImagesEqual): Update to use
	PixelRowIterateDualRead().
	(GetImageStatistics): Update to use PixelRowIterateMonoRead().

	* magick/pixel_row_iterator.h: New interfaces which are similar to
	the already existing interfaces in pixel_iterator.h except that
	they pass a row to the callback rather than one pixel.

	* magick/operator.c (QuantumOperatorRegionImage): Add progress
	monitor support.

	* magick/pixel_iterator.c (PixelIterateMonoRead): Add a
	`description` argument and progress monitor support.

	`description` argument and progress monitor support.
	(PixelIterateDualModify): Add a
	`description` argument and progress monitor support.

	* magick/resize.c (HorizontalFilter, VerticalFilter): Switch back
	to RoundSignedToQuantum() since some pixels were experiencing
	underflow.  Localize some variables so that we don't have to
	declare them as private for OpenMP.

2008-05-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac, magick/resize.c, PerlMagick/Makefile.PL.in: Added
	OpenMP support for parallelizing a task across multiple cores.

2008-05-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	Fixed compilation issue noticed with Visual C++ 2008.

2008-05-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/magick.c (GetMagickInfo): Simplify implementation.
	(RegisterMagickInfo): Remove any existing entry since module
	loading may result in duplicate entries.

2008-05-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* libtool: Update to libtool 1.2.4.

	* magick/magick.h (MagickInfo): Store string attributes as `const
	char *` to statically allocated data rather than as heap allocated
	strings.  THIS IS AN INTERFACE CHANGE.  Using a coder written to
	the old interface is non-fatal but may resemble a small memory
	leak.  The reason for the change is to avoid at least 880 needless
	malloc()/strlen()/strlcpy() operations at initialization time, and
	at least 880 free() calls at destruction time.  While these
	operations did not take long, they are still an unnecessary
	overhead, which is increased in thread-safe applications.

	* magick/module.c (OpenModule): Ignore requests to open modules
        which have already been opened.

	* GraphicsMagick.spec.in: Add --with-included-ltdl to the default
	options since this seems safest until the libltdl validation logic
	is fully robust.  This should be made user-configurable in the
	future.

	* magick/Makefile.am (magick_libGraphicsMagick_la_LIBADD): Apply
	libltdl dependency argument as required for building.

	* configure.ac: Intuit if the GraphicsMagick library will depend
	on -lltdl.

	* Magick++/bin/GraphicsMagick++-config.in: Use substitutions
	rather than invoking GraphicsMagick-config in order to determine
	GraphicsMagick library usage requirements.  This avoids problems
	when GraphicsMagick-config is not in the executable search path.

2008-05-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* GraphicsMagick.spec.in: NEWS was renamed to NEWS.txt.  Enable
	libtool verbose output so it is possible to diagnose build
	failures.

2008-05-01  Fojtik Jaroslav  <JaFojtik@seznam.cz>

	* mat.c: gm convert -limit Pixels 1 input_gray_lsb_16bit.mat crap.miff
	don't rotate partial image.

2008-04-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/magick.c (DestroyMagickInfoList): Use DestroyMagickInfo().
	(UnregisterMagickInfo): Use DestroyMagickInfo().
	(RegisterMagickInfo): Simplify dramatically by adding to the front
	of the list rather than maintaining alpha order.

	* magick/image.c (DestroyImageInfo): Tidy up and simplify code.

	* magick/constitute.c (WriteImage): Comment out the "bi-modal
	delegate" execution code until we determine what value it offers.
	The test suite passes without it.

	* magick/magick.h (struct MagickInfo): There is no need for `name`
	to be allocated data so make it const.	
	(DestroyMagickInfo): Add a static function to destroy a MagickInfo
	structure.  Renamed previous DestroyMagickInfo to
	DestroyMagickInfoList and made it static.

2008-04-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh: GraphicsMagick 1.2 released.
	CVS head is now 1.3 development.

	* png: Updated libpng to 1.2.27.

2008-04-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (SetImageInfo): Ignore file extensions which
	match defined virtual delegate entries (including stealth
	entries).

2008-04-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* BENCHMARKS.txt: Added timings for -blur.

2008-04-27  Darko Kojic  <dkc@sf.net>

	* magick/effect.c (MedianFilterImage): Fixes to compile on ARM
	CPU.

2008-04-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/magick.h (MagickInfo): Remove image_info member since I
	can not find any purpose for it.

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): Remove assertion check on
	scanline size since it has not caught anything.

	* magick/image.c (SetImageInfo): Ensure that the file extension
	does not trigger unwanted activity such as access to an X11
	server, printer, or the launch delegate.

	* config/Makefile.am (configshare_DATA): Install colors.mgk in
	share path.

	* magick/blob.c (GetConfigureBlob): Search `share` config path
	prior to `lib` config path.

2008-04-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c (WriteOnePNGImage): TrueColor RGB was usually
	written rather than the desired more compact format.  This is a
	first pass at fixing that.

2008-04-24  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* BENCHMARKS.txt: Added a benchmark summary.

2008-04-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac, magick/Makefile.am: Don't use libtdl unless we are
	supposed to be using it!

	* libtool: Updated to GNU libtool 1.2960 2008-04-19.

	* configure.ac, magick/delegate.h: It seems that the modern
	convention is to store ghostscript headers in a subdirectory
	called `ghostscript` rather than `ps`.
	We don't actually need Ghostscript errors.h and that is a good
	thing since it seems that some newer Ghostscript calls it ierrors.h

2008-04-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick/installer/inc/files-dlls.isx: Comment out inclusion
	of X11 support DLLs.

	* VisualMagick/magick/magick_config.h.in: X11 is no longer in the
	default Windows build.

2008-04-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/nt_base.c: Eliminate various annoying warnings noticed
	under MinGW.

	* magick/spinlock.h (_spinlock_release): Use `long` rather than

	* magick/command.c: Eliminated the long-deprecated -cache resource
	limit option.

	* magick/resource.c: Complete re-write of the resource limit
	system.  Resource specifications are now absolute except that they
	support a binary metric suffix such as `K` to scale the value.
	Added the `Pixels` limit type to limit the maximum number of
	pixels allowed for each image.

2008-04-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

2008-04-09  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <glennrp@simple....>

	* coders/png.c (ReadOnePNGImage) Use the low bits of the PNG
	tRNS values instead of scaling them when reducing from 16-bits.

2008-04-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Updated to Autoconf 2.62.

2008-04-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImageCommand): New -create-directories
	option automatically creates subdirectories as needed when
	-output-directory option is used.  This is useful when one
	directory tree of files is being mogrified to a new tree.

2008-04-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/utility.c (MagickCreateDirectoryPath): New function to
	create a directory path.  Will be used later.

	assertion to hopefully flush out any remaining cases where
	ExportImagePixelArea() writes past the end of its buffer.

	* magick/constitute.c (ExportImagePixelArea): GrayQuantum case for
	DirectClass pixels was sometimes writing a zero byte one past the
	end of the allocated buffer.  Thanks to Josue Gomes for reporting
	this bug.

2008-04-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/{pcd.c,pcx.c,pdb.c,pict.c,stegano.c,wpg.c,xcf.c}:
	Warnings reduction.	

	* magick/{channel.c,image.c,unix_port.c,render.c}: Warnings

	version of Visual C++ used to perform the build.  It is much safer
	for the developer to build the package from source with his own
	compiler.

2008-03-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Fix compilation issues with Microsoft Visual Studio.

2008-03-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Use memory allocation macros like the rest
	of the code.

	* magick/memory.c (MagickMalloc): New function which behaves
	similar to malloc().
	(MagickMallocArray): New function for allocating an array.
	(MagickRealloc): New function which behaves similar to realloc().
	(MagickFree): New function which behaves similar to free().
	(MagickAllocFunctions): New function to allow the user to specify
	the memory allocation functions.

	* magick/memory.h: New header file to define memory allocation

	already in a YCbCr colorspace.
	(ReadDPXImage): Return YCbCr images in YCbCr colorspace unless
	they are also Cineon log encoded.

	* magick/attribute.c (CloneImageAttributes): New function for
	copying image attributes from one image to another.

	* magick/utility.c (TranslateTextEx): Check if the pixel cache is
	initialized before using a function which requires using it.
	Thanks to Micha Kowalczuk for bringing this issue to my
	attention.

	* magick/attribute.c (SetImageAttribute): Only apply
	transformations to "comment" and "label" attributes.

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (GetPixelCachePresent): New function to
	test if the image pixel cache is present and initialized.

2008-03-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/colorspace.c (RGBTransformPacket): Rationalize casts for
	improved performance.

	* magick/image.c (GetImageDepth): Use table lookups to improve
	performance.

2008-03-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (AllocateImage): Transfer any attributes from
	ImageInfo to allocated image.
	(SetImageDepth): Use table lookups to improve performance.

2008-03-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImageCommand): Added an
	-output-directory option to `mogrify` to send output files to the
	specified directory.

2008-03-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/t/read.t: Add input_logical_lsb_08bit.mat to
	PerlMagick tests.

	* magick/nt_feature.c (CropImageToHBITMAP, ImageToHBITMAP): Use
	GlobalFree() to free bitmap handle.

2008-03-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/t/read.t: Added/adjusted WPG test files from Jaroslav
	Fojtik.

2008-03-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* AUTHORS.txt, BUGS.txt, FAQ.txt, NEWS.txt, PLATFORMS.txt,
	TODO.txt, INSTALL-unix.txt, INSTALL-windows.txt: Use
	reStructuredText format.

	* Makefile.am: Use reStructuredText for more files.

2008-02-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/constitute.c (ReadImage): Disable colorspace override
	code since it was being wrongly-triggered in X11 display commands.

2008-02-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/body.html: Update to mention 1.1.11 release.

2008-02-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/colorspace.c (RndToInt): Cast result to `unsigned int`
	rather than `int` in order to avoid possible value truncation with
	Q32 build.  Problem was reported by Kai-Uwe Behrmann.
	(TransformRGBImage): Fix loop iterator which was looping one past
	the end of the array.  Reported by Kai-Uwe Behrmann.

	* magick/command.c: Added a -set option to the composite, convert,
	display, mogrify, import commands in order to allow setting an
	image attribute.

2008-02-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Use MagickAcquireMemory() rather than
	AquireMemory().

	* coders/xwd.c (ReadXWDImage): Eliminate integer overflow
	vulnerability (IDefense 09.19.07).

	* coders/xbm.c (ReadXBMImage): ditto

	* coders/xcf.c (ReadXCFImage): ditto

	* coders/dib.c (ReadDIBImage): ditto

	* coders/dcm.c (ReadDCMImage): ditto

2008-02-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): The RFC 3949 specification for
	Internet FAX recommends LSB2MSB fill order so document that.

2008-02-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): Use `-define
	tiff:fill-order={msb2lsb|lsb2msb}` to control TIFF bit fill order.

2008-02-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Updated to latest CVS libtool.

	* coders/tiff.c (CompressionSupported): Use
	TIFFGetConfiguredCODECs() to test if a requested compression type
	is supported by libtiff.  Based on advice from Frank Warmerdam.

	* configure.ac: Add test for TIFFGetConfiguredCODECs() in libtiff.

2008-02-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c: With libtiff 3.6.1, including tiff.h and tiffio.h
	is not sufficient to obtain the definitions from tiffconf.h so
	libtiff is assumed to not support any features, such as
	compression.  Avoid this problem by explicitly including
	tiffconf.h if it is found.  This resolves SourceForge issue
	[1883527] compression of tiff-file has no effect.

2008-02-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick/installer/inc/setup.isx: Set Inno Setup installer
	compression to "lzma/max".

	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Eliminate use of memory allocation macros
	since these failed miserably under Windows where it seems that
	malloc, free, and realloc are redefined via macros by the Perl
	build environment.  This reverts changes made on 2007-12-01.

	* magick/memory.c (MagickAcquireMemoryArray): Use implementation
	from the 1.1 branch.

	* magick/utility.h: Remove MagickSafeMultiplySize_t since it seems
	that use of inline functions in Windows is a disaster area.

2008-02-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Makefile.am (windows-dist): Create a 7z compressed Windows
	comprehensive source package.  See http://www.7-zip.org/ for
	information on Windows 7-Zip and http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/ for
	information on portable 7-Zip (P7ZIP).

2008-02-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): Add logging for image resolution
	and resolution units.

	* magick/version.h.in: Update copyright year to 2008.

2008-02-01  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>
	
	* configure.ac: Updated for libtool-2.1b.

	* bootstrap (libtoolize): Libtoolize can figure out the mode and
	directory for libltdl from configure.ac.

2008-01-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* magick/Makefile.am: Update
	magick_libGraphicsMagick_la_DEPENDENCIES to use LTDLDEPS.

2008-01-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (SetImageInfo): Successfully read existing file
	names in the form file[123] which were failing to read since they
	appear to be a valid sub-image specification.

2008-01-24  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/utility.c (ExpandFilenames): If a filename appears to
	contain a wildcard specification, first check to see if there is
	file matching the unexpanded wildcard prior to engaging in the
	slow task of wildcard expansion.  Without this fix, expanding the
	command line takes a very long time if there are a huge number of
	files in the directory, and some file names appear to contain
	wildcard specifications.  Inspired by SourceForge bug reports [
	1878992 ] "literal square brackets in file name cause large delay"
	and [ 1783209 ] "converting runs slowly when subimage is
	specified", but this might not be the complete fix for the
	problem.

2008-01-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Makefile.am: Update to Automake 1.10.1 and enable generation of
	an lzma compressed source package.

2008-01-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Added configure option --with-umem to enable use
	of the umem memory allocation library available in Solaris 9,
	Update 3 and later, or from
	https://labs.omniti.com/trac/portableumem/.  This library supports
	concurrency in multi-threaded programs and supports debugging
	memory issues.  See
	http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/libumem_library.html
	for a description of how to use the library for debugging memory
	issues.

2008-01-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (VersionCommand): Include a "Large Memory" item
	in the Feature Support list.

	* coders/png.c (RegisterPNGImage): Remove reference to dead PNG
	ftp site.

	* VisualMagick/configure/configure.cpp (InitInstance): Remove
	project dependency on dxguid.lib (Direct-X).

2008-01-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Update libtool to latest CVS version.

2008-01-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (DisplayImageCommand): No longer default to
	reading standard input if stdin fails isatty() test.  This
	behavior was causing failure to launch from Gnome and it is
	difficult to work around the issue from within a .desktop file.	
	(AnimateImageCommand): No longer default to
	reading standard input if stdin fails isatty() test.
