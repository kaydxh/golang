<p>Special Issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It has been discovered that the 'ICU' library (a perhaps 30MB C++
library) which is now often a libxml2 dependendency causes huge
process initialization overhead.  This is noticed as unexpected
slowness when GraphicsMagick utilities are used to process small to
medium sized files.  The time to initialize the 'ICU' library is
often longer than the time that GraphicsMagick would otherwise
require to read the input file, process the image, and write the
output file.  If the 'ICU' dependency can not be avoided, then make
sure to use the modules build so there is only impact for file
formats which require libxml2.  Please lobby the 'ICU' library
developers to change their implementation to avoid long start-up
times due to merely linking with the library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security Fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
2018, 398 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz (some of which were
benign build issues) and 11 issues remain open.
The issues list is available at
<a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list">https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list</a> under search term
&quot;graphicsmagick&quot;.  Issues are available for anyone to view and
duplicate if they have been in &quot;Verified&quot; status for 30 days, or if
they have been in &quot;New&quot; status for 90 days.  There are too many
fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
for details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fix broken definition of ResourceInfinity which resulted in that
GetMagickResource() would return -1 rather than the maximum range
value for the return type as documented. (problem added by the
1.3.32 release).</li>
<li>ModifyCache(): Re-open the pixel cache if the cache rows/columns do
not match the owning image rows/columns.</li>
<li>Fix DisplayImages() return status.  The return status was inverted.</li>
<li>HISTOGRAM: Histogram once again includes the histogram as a text
comment.  This became broken by previous security fixes.</li>
<li>PICT: Fixed heap buffer overuns reported multiple sources.</li>
<li>JNG: Detect when JPEG encoder has failed and throw an exception.</li>
<li>MVG/DrawImage(): Performs even more parsing validations.</li>
<li>Clang static analyzer fixes: A great many fixes were made based on
problem reports by the Clang static analyzer.</li>
<li>Visual Studio static analyzer fixes: A great many fixes were made
based on problem reports by the Visual Studio 2019 static analyzer.
Many of these may improve the robustness of 64-bit code.</li>
</ul>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>GRADIENT/GradientImage(): Improved accuracy of gradient levels as
well as dramaticaly improving performance.  Output PseudoClass
images if we can.  Add support for using the image 'gravity'
attribute as well as the &quot;gradient:direction&quot; definition to produce
gradient vector directions corresponding to SouthGravity (the
previously-existing default), NorthGravity, WestGravity,
EastGravity, NorthWestGravity, NorthEastGravity, SouthWestGravity,
and SouthEastGravity.</li>
</ul>
<p>API Updates:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>InitializeMagickEx(): New function which may be used in place of
InitializeMagick() to initialize GraphicsMagick.  This
initialization function returns an error status value, may update a
passed ExceptionInfo structure with error information, and provides
an options parameter which supports simple bit-flags to tailor
initialization.  The signal handler registrations are skipped if the
MAGICK_OPT_NO_SIGNAL_HANDER flag is set in the options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feature improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Replace use of non-reentrant legacy POSIX functions with reentrant
equivalents.</li>
<li>Timing of image reads should now be very accurate.  The timer was
sometimes not stopped as soon as it should be.</li>
<li>PICT: The PICT reader is working pretty good now.  It handles all
the PICT image files I have available to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>None</li>
</ul>
<p>Build Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Visual Studio Build: Configure program now provides a checkbox to
enable common optimizations for better performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>POSIX Signals: Use the normal termination signal handler for SIGXCPU
and SIGXFSZ so that ulimit or setrlimit(2) may be used to apply CPU
(RLIMIT_CPU) and output file size (RLIMIT_FSIZE) limits with the
normal cleanup, and without dumping core. Note that any output files
currently being written may be truncated and files being written by
external programs (e.g. Ghostscript) might be left behind unless
they are to a temporary file assigned by GraphicsMagick.</li>
<li>Some private string and integer constants were removed from the
apparent library ABI.  Some private functions were marked static and
removed from the apparent library ABI.  This is mentioned because
someone is sure to notice and be concerned about it.</li>
<li>The remaining private content in installed header files was moved
into -private.h header files which are not installed.  This should
not be cause for concern but is mentiond because someone is sure to
notice and be concerned about it.</li>

which may be over-ridden using log.mgk as soon as it is loaded.</li>
<li>Windows Build: Search registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER as well as
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE when searching for Ghostscript.  By following the
procedure documented in SourceForge bug 615 &quot;GhostScript
installation check&quot;, this allows for local user installations

<li>TIFF reader: Apply memory resource limits to strip and tile allocations.</li>
<li>WMF reader: Fixed a division by zero problem.</li>
<li>XWD reader: Many heap buffer overflows and uses of uninitialized data were fixed.</li>
<li>Pixel cache: Now apply resource limits to pixel nexus allocations
using the same limits (total pixels, width, height, memory) as
applied to the whole image since some requests are directly
influenced by the input file.  More tests are added for arithmetic
overflow.  Care was taken to minimize performance impact due to the
many extra checks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>See above note about oss-fuzz fixes.</li>

<li><p class="first">Library metrics: The number of shared library relocations and the
amount of initialized data has been signficantly reduced by
following recommendations from Ulrich Drepper's document <a class="reference external" href="https://akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf">How To
Write Shared Libraries</a>.</p>
<p>For comparison, these are the differences in library metrics between
the 1.3.31 and 1.3.32 releases for a simple shared library with all
features supported:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="17%" />
<col width="25%" />

<th class="head">Relocations</th>
<th class="head">Initialized Data</th>
<th class="head">Total Size</th>

</tr>
<tr><td>1.3.32</td>
<td>747</td>
<td>127,936</td>
<td>3,033,279</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>and these are the differences in library metrics between 1.3.31 and
1.3.32 for a shared library using the modules option (recommended!)
with all features supported:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>As can be seen, the number of relocations was extreme and has been
reduced to reasonable levels while also diminishing the amount of
initialized data and the total size of the library/program.  Most of
the remaining initialized data (106,648 bytes) and some of the
relocations (65 relocations) may be attributed to the optional X11
animate/display/import support.</p>

</ul>
<p>Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>None</li>

<p>Build Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The test suite now passes even if no fonts are found.</li>
<li>Configure script does better at finding Windows fonts on non-Windows systems.</li>
<li>The configure script now supports the option --with-mtmalloc to
enable use of the mtmalloc library as found on Solaris-derived

</ul>
<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>AnnotateImage(): No longer implicitly call TranslateText() since
this is not suitable for most use-cases and causes additional

<li>Firmware and operating system updates to address the Spectre
vulnerability (and possibly to some extent the Meltdown

about this.</li>

<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>See above note about oss-fuzz fixes.</li>
<li>CINEON: Fix unexpected hang on a crafted Cineon image.  SourceForge
issue 571.</li>
<li>Drawing recursion is limited to 100 and may be tuned via the
MAX_DRAWIMAGE_RECURSION pre-processor definition.</li>
<li>Fix reading MIFF files using legacy keyword 'color-profile' for ICC
color profile as was used by ImageMagick 4.2.9.</li>
<li>Fix reading/writing files when 'magick' is specified in lower case.
This bug was a regression in 1.3.30.</li>
</ul>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>TIFF: Support Zstd compression in TIFF.  This requires libtiff
4.0.10 or later.</li>
<li>TIFF: Support WebP compression in TIFF.  This requires libtiff
4.0.10 or later.</li>
</ul>
<p>API Updates:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>MagickMonitor() is marked as deprecated.  Code should not be using
this function any more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feature improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The progress monitor callbacks (registered using MagickMonitor() or
MagickMonitorFormatted()) are serialized via a common semaphore
rather than via critical sections in OpenMP loops.  OpenMP loops are
updated to use OpenMP 'atomic' and 'flush' to update shared loop
variables rather than using a OpenMP 'critical' construct, reducing
contention.  Performance on some targets is observed to have been
improved by this change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>None</li>
</ul>
<p>Build Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There was already a 'compare' command installed with the
'--enable-magick-compat' configure option was used but it did not
function.  Now it functions.  There was no <cite>compare</cite> command in
ImageMagick 5.5.2 and this compare command is only roughly similar
to a <cite>compare</cite> command in some subsequent ImageMagick release.</li>
<li>Removed Remove Ghostscript library support (--with-gslib) from
configure script.  The 'HasGS' pre-processor defines which were
enabled by this remain in the source code so it is still possible to
use this library if absolutely necessary (e.g. CPPFLAGS=-DHasGS
LIBS=-lgs).</li>
<li>No longer explicitly link with the OpenMP library when it will be
supplied already due to CFLAGS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>JPEG: Libjpeg-turbo is allowed 1/5th the memory resource limit
provided for Graphicsmagick via the cinfo-&gt;mem-&gt;max_memory_to_use
option, which is part of the IJG JPEG API/ABI, but usually not
supported there.  This feature works for libjpeg-turbo 1.5.2 and
later.  Limiting the memory usage is useful since libjpeg-turbo may
otherwise consume arbitrary amounts of memory even before
Graphicsmagick is informed of the image dimensions.</li>
<li>JPEG: The maximum number of JPEG progressive scans is limited to 50.
Otherwise some technically valid files could be read for almost
forever.</li>

now being tested rather than the 'configure' default of Q8.</li>
</ul>
<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>JPEG: The JPEG reader now allows 3 warnings of any particular type
before giving up on reading and throwing an exception.  This choice
was made after observing files which produce hundreds of warnings
and consume massive amounts of memory before reading the image data
has even started.  It is currently unknown how many files which were
previously accepted will be rejected by default.  The number of
allowed warnings may be adjusted using '-define
jpeg:max-warnings=&lt;value&gt;'.  The default limit will be adjusted
based on reported user experiences and may be adjusted prior to

<p>Security Fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>EscapeParenthesis(): I was notified by Gustavo Grieco of a heap
overflow in EscapeParenthesis() used in the text annotation code.
While not being able to reproduce the issue, the implementation of
this function is completely redone.  This issue was assigned
CVE-2016-7447 after the release.</li>
<li>Utah RLE: Reject truncated/absurd files which caused huge memory
allocations and/or consumed huge CPU.  Problem was reported by
Agostino Sarubbo based on testing with AFL.  This issue was assigned
CVE-2016-7448 after the release.</li>
<li>SVG/MVG: Fix another case of CVE-2016-2317 (heap buffer overflow) in
the MVG rendering code (also impacts SVG).  This issue (remaining
part) was assigned CVE-2016-7446 after the release.</li>
<li>TIFF: Fix heap buffer read overflow while copying sized TIFF
attributes.  Problem was reported by Agostino Sarubbo based on
testing with AFL.  This issue was assigned CVE-2016-7449 after the
release.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>GetToken(): Fix obscure bug (read beyond end of string buffer)
noticed while parsing a MVG file.  This problem was reported by
Gustavo Grieco.</li>
<li>MVG rendering: Fix undesired hard errors when some objects were
drawn outside of the image bounds.  Requests to draw objects
entirely outside of the image should be silently ignored.</li>
<li>MVG/SVG rendering: Fix gradient size sanity checks which were
causing gradient requests to fail.  Due to a design weakness in that
gradient images allocate resources rather than being computations at
point of use, the maximum gradient image size is now hard-limited to
5000x5000 pixels until the design problem is fixed.  Some SVG icons
(as small as 8x8 pixels) authored using Inkscape request absurdly
huge gradients.  Gradient sizes as large as 20,000x20,000 have been
observed in SVG icon files delivered by packages on an Ubuntu Linux

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">1.3.24 (May 30, 2016)</a></h1>
<p>Special Issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A shell exploit (CVE-2016-5118) was discovered associated with a
filename syntax where file names starting with '|' are intepreted as
shell commands executed via popen().  Insufficient sanitization in
the SVG and MVG renderers allows such filenames to be passed through
from potentially untrusted files.  There might be other ways for
untrusted inputs to produce such filenames.  Due to this issue,
support for the feature is removed entirely.</li>
<li>A shell exploit was discovered associated with the gnuplot delegate
and which is triggered by the 'gplt' entry in delegates.mgk.  A
remote exploit is possible if the attacker can cause a provided SVG
or MVG file to be rendered (or the user opens a provided file).  The
gnuplot program must be installed in order for the exploit to be
successful.  It is strongly recommended to remove this entry in all
delegates.mgk files.</li>
<li>Due to <a class="reference external" href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53967">GCC bug 53967</a>, several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
enabled for floating point math (<cite>-mfpmath=sse</cite>) if the GCC option
<cite>-frename-registers</cite> is used. Default 32-bit builds do not
experience the problem since they use '387 math.  It is not clear in
what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed by
the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe.  Other compilers do not
suffer from this bug.  Please lobby the GCC project to fix this
embarrassing performance bug.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security Fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>BLOB: Remove support for reading input from a shell command, or
writing output to a shell command, by prefixing the specified
filename (containing the command) with a '|'.  This feature provided
a remote shell execution opportunity.</li>
<li>DIB: Fixed out of bounds reads.  Added more header validations.</li>
<li>JNG: File size limits are enforced.</li>
<li>MAT: Fixed denial of service opportunity.  Fix hang on corrupt deflate stream.</li>
<li>META: Fixed out of bounds reads and writes.</li>
<li>MIFF: Fixed thrown assertion.</li>
<li>MSL: Ignore the file extension on MSL files.  It is necessary to add
a &quot;msl:&quot; prefix to MSL files to read the as an image.</li>
<li>MVG: No longer assume that files ending with extension &quot;.mvg&quot; are
MVG files.  MVG parsing does more validity checking on its input.
Assure that enough PrimitiveInfo structures are allocated in advance
to support a given vector path (heap overflow problem).</li>
<li>PCX: Fixed unreasonable memory allocation due to intentionally
corrupt file.</li>
<li>PDB: Fixed a heap buffer overflow and out of bounds read.</li>
<li>PICT: Fixed an out of bounds write.</li>
<li>PS: Ghostscript is now always run with -dSAFER for safer execution.</li>

<li>ReadImages(): Fixed a possible infinite recursion due to a crafted input file.</li>
<li>RotateImage(): Fixed thrown assertion.</li>
<li>SGI: Fixed out of bounds writes.</li>
<li>SUN: Fixed out of bounds reads and writes.</li>
<li>SVG: Fixed heap and stack buffer overflows, as well as segmentation
violations (CVE-2016-2317 and CVE-2016-2318).  Also fixed endless
loop, unexpectedly large memory allocation, divide by zero, and
recursion issues.</li>
<li>TIFF: Fixed an assertion while reading.  Fixed benign heap overflow.</li>
<li>TMP: Adding a &quot;tmp:&quot; prefix to a filename no longer removes the file
since this seems dangerous.</li>
<li>VIFF: Fix excessive memory allocation with intentionally corrupted input file.</li>
<li>XCF: Fixed a heap buffer overflow.</li>
<li>XPM: Fixed several heap buffer overflows, and out of bound
reads/writes.  Also fixed a case of excessive memory allocation.</li>
<li>delegate.mgk: The default delegate.mgk file has been pared down in
order to reduce security exposure.</li>
<li>gnuplot ('gplt' delegate in delegates.mgk): Support for rendering
gnuplot files is removed since the format is inherently insecure.</li>

<p>New Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>compose: Supports composite operator names similar to the major
*Magick brand, without losing any compatibility with previous
naming.</li>
<li>ICO: Windows ICO reader now supports reading PNG-encoded files.</li>
<li>Magick++ Geometry: New methods limitPixels() and fillArea() to
support '&#64;' and '^' geometry qualifiers.  This enhancement breaks
the ABI due to previous use of inline methods and no place to put
the new flags.</li>
<li>Magick++ Image::extent(): New method to place image on sized
canvas of constant color using gravity.</li>
<li>Magick++ Image::formatExpression(): New method format a string
based on a format similar to command-line -format.</li>
<li>Magick++ Image::resize(): New method to resize image specifying
geometry, filter, and blur.</li>
<li>Magick++ STL extentImage: New function object to invoke image
extent method.</li>
<li>Magick++ Image::quiet().  New method which blocks (ignores)
warning exceptions when passed a 'true' argument.</li>
<li>Resource limits: Added support for image Width and Height limits.
Default image Width and Height limits are based on the range of a
32-bit signed integer, even for 64-bit builds which may have
sufficient numeric range to image an entire galaxy.  Limits may be
increased as desired.</li>
<li>TIFF: Use define tiff:ignore-tags to ignore tags in 'corrupted'
files with unknown and invalid tags.  Use to read TIFF files which
otherwise can not be read due to errors.</li>
<li>TIFF: Use '-define tiff:report-warnings=true' to enable that
warnings reported by libtiff are thrown as warning exceptions so
that they may be caught or will be reported at the gm
command-line.</li>
<li>Windows Exceptions: A handler is registered (due to calling
InitializeMagick()) to capture Windows Exceptions in a similar
manner to the existing POSIX signal handler.  If an application is
using the library and wants to provide its own Windows exception
handling, then it should make any changes after invoking
InitializeMagick().</li>

<li>Clang/LLVM: Provide support for clang/llvm attribute and builtin
specifiers similar to that provided for GCC.</li>
<li>OpenMP: OpenMP native locking and thread specific data is
supported via a configuration option (is not the default).  This
offers a &quot;pure&quot; OpenMP compilation mode.  No real value for this
compilation mode has been observed yet but it seems worthy to
support.</li>
<li>Coders: Added BrokenCoderClass to mark coders which often
malfunction or are not very useful in their current condition.</li>

<li>VisualMagick configure: Improve configure program so that it is
possible to select QuantumDepth, OpenMP, and 64-bit build via
configure dialog boxes as well as options on the command line.
Also automatically detects and deals with similarly named files in
subdirectories so that WebP support can now build successfully.</li>

interpretation of how alpha should be handled.  No longer does a
simple multiply of alpha channel.</li>

&lt;freetype/freetype.h&gt; can be included.</li>
<li>CMS profile: Only delete the CMS transform if it is non-null.
Fixed assertion observed when lcms returned a null profile and
GraphicsMagick attempted to deallocate it.</li>
<li>Drawing: Improve error handling logic so that drawing returns
quickly on pixel access errors rather than plowing on ahead.  This
avoids problems with SVGs which take seemingly forever to render.</li>
<li>Drawing via C/C++ APIs: <cite>BevelJoin</cite> no longer causes a MVG parsing
error.</li>
<li>EPT: Fix crash observed when Ghostscript fails to produce useful
output.  This was particularly noticeable when Ghostscript was not

<li>OpenMP: Revert use of omp_set_dynamic() since it caused
performance issues when using GCC's GOMP implementation and the
number of threads to use is specified.</li>
<li>EXIF profile: Support the <cite>SubjectArea</cite> EXIF tag.</li>
<li>MIFF writer: PseudoClass format was written incorrectly for depth
greater than 8.</li>
<li>MIFF writer: RLE compressed format used inverted alpha from the
other subformats contrary to the MIFF specification.</li>
<li>MIFF reader: Fixes to be able to read MIFF written by
ImageMagick 6.X, including DirectClass grayscale images (except
for RLE compressed).</li>
<li>Mosaic: Fixed unsigned underflow problem with -mosaic when page
offset is negative and exceeds image width or height, resulting in
assertions, out of memory errors, or pixel cache limit errors.</li>
<li>PDF: Consistently initialize Image page width and height to image
width and height.  While general to all of GraphicsMagick, this
change is to assure that the PDF writer computes page dimensioning
consistently.  PDF page dimensioning was wrong if the image had
been resized with -geometry &quot;100%&quot;.</li>
<li>PAM: Fix MAXVAL scaling when reading PAM images.  PAM was only
working correctly for images with 256 or 64k levels.</li>
<li>PNM: PGM &quot;P2&quot; format writer wrote bad output for 8-bit depth.</li>
<li>PNG: With libpng 1.6.X, avoid a crash while copying a PNG with a
&quot;known incorrect ICC profile&quot;.</li>
<li>PNG: Q8 GM build now correctly reads 16-bit PNG files.</li>
<li>TIFF writer: Try to avoid writing more than 32k strips per image
by increasing rows-per-strip since some programs fail to read
images with more than 32k strips per image.</li>
<li>TIM reader: PSX TIM reports 8-bit depth (rather than 16).</li>
<li>TTF font rendering: Improve FreeType rendering error logic so that

<li>Windows Ghostscript: 64-bit GraphicsMagick no longer requires both
32-bit and 64-bit builds of Ghostscript to be installed in order
to read Postscript and PDF formats.</li>

PAM formats, support writing and reading 32-bit sample depth.
Writing such files is only supported by the Q32 build although
they may be read by any build.</li>
<li>WebP: Now supports reading and writing Google's WebP format.  This
feature is not currently supported by the Windows Visual Studio
build.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Feature improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pixel composition based on BlendCompositePixel() is enhanced to
completely eliminate under-color from the blending if the
under-pixel is fully transparent.  Also blends based on the
average opacity of both pixels rather than only the over-pixel.
This change did not result in any change in the GM test suite
results but it is possible that there could be some negative
impact from it.  Please report any issues noticed which are due to
this change.</li>
<li>X11 <cite>display</cite>: For DirectClass image, use ThumbnailImage() rather
than SampleImage() when creating the panner icon to improve the
quality of the image.</li>

<p>Windows Delegate Updates:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Updated IJG JPEG library to release 9.</li>
<li>Updated PNG library to release 1.6.8.</li>
<li>Updated lcms2 library to release 2.5.</li>
<li>Updated libxml2 library to release 2.9.1.</li>
<li>Updated FreeType library to release 2.5.2.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>MIFF: Now writes PseudoClass images correctly when depth is
greater than 8.  This impacts the reader, which will not be able
to read previously written incorrect format correctly.  Images
like this should be very rare.  The solution is to use an older
GraphicsMagick version to convert such images to a valid storage
format (with a depth of 8) so that they may be read with this
version.</li>
<li>MIFF: Now writes RLE-compressed RGBA images with correct
alpha. This impacts the reader, which will not be able to read
previously written incorrect format correctly. Images like this
should be very rare. A solution is to use an older GraphicsMagick
version to use a compression algorithm other than RLE so that they
are read correctly with this version.  Another solution is to
process problematic images with '-operator Opacity Negate 0' to
invert the alpha channel.</li>
<li>TIFF: Returns DirectClass images by default for MINISWHITE and
MINISBLACK TIFF formats (rather then colormapped).</li>
<li>Windows: Also search c:gsfonts for Ghostscript font files.  This
search path is normally hard-coded into Ghostscript binaries and
is a convenient place to put fonts so they may be shared by
multiple Ghostscript versions.</li>
<li>XPM: Now limits color resolution to 16-bits, even with Q32 build.</li>

<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed bug with format substitutions if input string ends with a
single '%'.</li>
<li>BMP: Fixed an old bug with decoding chromaticity primaries.</li>
<li>PNG: Fixed reading of interlaced images.  Fix reading of sub-8-bit
palette and grayscale images.  Some PNG sub-formats were written
incorrectly.  Fix crash in PNG8 writer if image colors happened to
be non-zero but image was not actually colormapped.</li>
<li>PNG: Configure script now also searches for libpng versions 16 and
17.</li>
<li>TIFF: Fix a crash which was noticed when writing RGBA separated
(planar) format.</li>
<li><cite>--enable-symbol-prefix</cite> was not prefixing all of the C
symbols. Some core C library functions were not prefixed.  This
option applies to the Wand library API as well now.</li>
<li>C API: When input is from a user-provided file descriptor, the
file position is restored after reading the file header bytes.
Previously the file position was rewound to the beginning of the
file.  This allows reading embedded image data from the current
offset in a file, and allows continuing to use the stream after
GraphicsMagick has returned the image.</li>
<li>C API: It is now possible to invoke CloseBlob() multiple times.</li>
<li>display: Display was supposed to respond to +/-usePixmap, but was
not. It was responding to +/-use_pixmap.  Now it responds to both.</li>
<li>Windows/VisualMagick: Fix building GraphicsMagick with Intel ICC
compiler driven by Visual Studio Professional 2012.</li>
<li>Windows: Avoid a crash and produce a useful diagnostic if
Ghostscript is needed but not yet installed.</li>

which supports executing any number of other GM utility
sub-commands in a single invocation in a sort of &quot;batch&quot; script.
Input may be piped from standard input, from a specified file, or
from a 'GM &gt;' command prompt.  This utilities front-end allows any
other program/script to drive 'gm' using a co-process model and
speeds up execution by eliminating utility start-up/shut-down
time.</li>
<li>WIN64 (64-bit Windows): Windows 64-bit is now officially supported.</li>
<li>convert/mogrify: Now support -auto-orient to automatically rotate
the image upright for viewing based on its current orientation
setting.  Also support -orient to support setting the current
image orientation.  Please note that the orientation property of
EXIF profiles is not yet updated so the EXIF profile will be wrong
after using -auto-orient.</li>
<li>C API: AutoOrientImage(), new function to automatically orient
the image so that it is upright for normal viewing.</li>
<li>Wand API: MagickGetImagePage()/MagickSetImagePage(), new functions
to support getting and setting the image page size and offsets.</li>
<li>PNG: Added PNG48 and PNG64 support. Added PNG00 support (png
encoder that inherits its color-type and bit-depth from the input,
if the input was a PNG datastream).</li>

<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>-convolve, -recolor: Validate that user-provided matrix is square

core dump.</li>
<li>CALS: Reading images taller than the image width resulted in a
failure.</li>
<li>ConstituteImage(), DispatchImage(): 'A' and 'T' should indicate
transparency and 'O' should indicate opacity.  Behavior was
inconsistent.  In some cases 'O' meant transparency while in other

not supporting formats provided via 'dcraw'.</li>
<li>GetOptimalKernelWidth1D(), GetOptimalKernelWidth2D(): In the Q32
build, convolution kernel size was estimated incorrectly for large
sigmas on 32-bit systems due to arithmetic overflow.  This could
cause wrong results for -convolve, -blur, -sharpen, and other
algorithms which use these functions.</li>
<li>Image Size: Fixed the ability to pass the image size via the
filename specification like &quot;myfile.jpg[640x480]&quot; rather than

<li>JPEG compression settings are preserved (if possible) when
inserting JPEG blobs into formats which use JPEG.</li>
<li>PDF: If the original file used JPEG compression, then use JPEG
compression with original settings (if possible).</li>
<li>TIFF: Update Windows build to use libtiff 3.9.2.</li>
<li>X11 Display: Apply a checkerboard pattern underneath transparent
images which use more than simple binary transparency.</li>

preserve full precision in Q32 build.</li>
<li>String data is dealt with a bit more efficiently (fewer
allocations, less memory, and less CPU).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>InitializeMagick() MUST be invoked prior to using any Magick API
function.  Failure to do so will likely lead to an immediate
application crash.  This is due to initialization and runtime
changes intended to improve thread safety and efficiency.
Previously it was only strongly recommended to invoke
InitializeMagick().</li>
<li>ConstituteImage(), DispatchImage(): 'A' and 'T' should indicate
transparency and 'O' should indicate opacity.  Behavior was
inconsistent.  In some cases 'O' meant transparency while in other
cases it meant opacity. Also, in a few cases, matte was not
getting enabled in the image as it should.</li>
<li>colors.mgk: Is now empty to default and is optional.  Previous
content is now compiled into the library in an efficient way, but
existing values may be modified, or new values added by adding
entries to color.mgk.</li>
<li>DisableSlowOpenMP is now the default.  Use --enable-openmp-slow to
enable OpenMP for algorithms which sometimes run slower rather
than faster.</li>
<li>magic.mgk: This configuration file is no longer used since this
data is now compiled into the library in an efficient way.</li>
<li>modules.mgk: Is now empty to default and is optional.  Previous
content is now compiled into the library in an efficient way, but
existing values may be modified, or new values added by adding
entries to modules.mgk.</li>
<li>Third party executables not included in the Visual Studio build
are no longer bundled in the GraphicsMagick installer.  This means
that hp2xx.exe, mpeg2dec.exe, and mpeg2enc.exe are no longer
distributed.</li>

<li>ICC color transforms now see linear speedup from OpenMP.</li>
<li>Rotate: For rotations of 90 or 270 degrees, tile sizes are
selected more appropriately.</li>

<li>OpenMP: Fix (benign) multi-thread cross-contentions (detected by
valgrind's Helgrind).</li>
<li>TIFF: Fix problem with reading one bit per sample RGB images.</li>
<li>TIFF: Writer was using rows-per-strip of 8 when writing
JPEG-compressed TIFF.  This does not work for vertical
subsampling, and some TIFF readers insist on 16.  The
rows-per-strip is now required to be a multiple of 16.</li>
<li>TIFF: In some cases, the TIFF reader and writer were accessing
planar TIFF in row-order rather than plane-order, which resulted
in sever buffering problems in libtiff, and failure when

<p>New Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added HRS reader for slow scan TV (contributed by Fojtik Jaroslav).</li>
<li>Pthreads (POSIX threads) API may now be used under the WIN32 API.</li>
<li>New access confirmation facility (MagickConfirmAccess) to allow
the API user to monitor and/or block access to files and URLs.
This allows the API user to implement a security policy based on
actual accesses.</li>
<li>New color matrix function (ColorMatrixImage) to apply a color
matrix similar to Adobe Flash Flash.filters.colorMatrixFilter(),
and Windows GDI+ ColorMatrix class, (order up to 5x5) to the image
pixels.  This is accessible via the -recolor command option.</li>
<li>Added an IDENTITY coder to return a Hald identity CLUT image of
specified order (e.g. &quot;identity:8&quot;).</li>
<li>Added a Hald CLUT capability as described at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html">http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html</a>.  This allows a
color transformation to be easily created and replicated on any
number of images.  The algorithm is accessed by the -hald-clut
option of 'convert' and 'mogrify'.  Original algorithm by Eskil
Steenberg and adapted for GraphicsMagick by Clément Follet, with
additional work by Bob Friesenhahn.</li>
<li>Added support for the ASC CDL transform.  Available as -asc-cdl
via the 'convert' and 'mogrify' subcommands.  Original
implementation by Clément Follet but considerably re-worked by Bob
Friesenhahn.  Implementation passes the +/- 1 count accuracy
requirement required by the ASC CDL SOP tests.</li>
<li>Added support for reading CALS Type 1 format (contributed by John
Sergeant).  CALS is a standard raster format used by the US
Department of Defense for storing blueprint images.</li>
<li>Added a random number generation system based on George
Marsaglia's multiply-with-carry generator.  Somewhat slower than
rand() but produces better random numbers with a period &gt;2^60.
This is a much better random number generator than the C library
rand() and the algorithm is integrated in a way which maximizes
multi-thread performance.</li>
<li>The 'compare' command now supports a -maximum-error option to
specify the maximum image error so that it may be used to support
boolean logic in automated test scripts.</li>
<li>For OpenMP-builds, the '-list resource' output now indicates the
number of threads which will be used.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Feature improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Image resize now avoids adding &quot;halos&quot; around objects when
resizing an image which contains transparency (patch contributed by
Pavel Merdin).</li>
<li>DICOM: The DICOM reader is completely re-written and is much more
functional now.  A few features (e.g. RLE compression) are still
missing.  This work is contributed by John Sergeant.</li>
<li>EXIF: Unprintable characters in EXIF attribute strings are now
returned using three-digit octal notation.  Unknown tags are
identified via their four-character hex value.</li>
<li>PCL: PCL writer is rewritten to fix many bugs, add support for

<li>TXT: The TXT reader is now capable of reading image files written
by the TXT writer, as well continuing to render ASCII text into an
image (work contributed by Fojtik Jaroslav).</li>
<li>Utilities &#64;file.txt syntax for including a list of files to use as
an argument now really works as expected.  This may be used to
inject any other text into the command line as well.  As a result,
the 'mogrify' utility may be invoked on thousands of files at once
while obtaining the list of files to process from a text file.</li>
<li>The 'mogrify' utility now caches argument images so that they are
loaded only once when mogrify is used to process multiple image
files.</li>

physical memory is available. Important for large-memory machines.</li>
<li>Fixed NTreaddir() so that it does not write beyond its buffer.</li>
<li>Fixed opendir() emulation function so it can't overwrite the stack.</li>

build parameters.</li>
<li>Logging of thrown exceptions is now supported. Use '-debug

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Coder additions/improvements</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The META coder supports wide characters for the IPTC and 8BIM
formats.</li>
<li>The XTRN coder now supports wide characters.</li>
<li>An &quot;IMAGE&quot; coder is provided which provides access to a large
number of images (derived from XFig) suitable for use as patterns,
or as test images.</li>
<li>The &quot;PATTERN&quot; coder now returns an image pattern tiled to size
(equivalent results to TILE:IMAGE:pattern). This is for ImageMagick
compatibility.</li>
<li>The CINEON coder now supports reading and writing images in CINEON
&quot;CIN&quot; linear gray and RGB formats. The read support is still very
weak, but it works for common images.</li>
<li>The JPEG coder now estimates the original JPEG quality and sampling
factors and will reuse these options when writing JPEG if the image
is of the same type and the option &quot;-define JPEG:preserve-settings&quot;
is supplied.</li>
<li>The JPEG-2000 coder now supports all Jasper library arguments using
command line syntax similar to '-define jp2:rate=0.5'.</li>
<li>Reading and writting compressed SVG (SVGZ) is now supported.</li>
<li>The TXT coder now observes depth when writing.</li>
<li>The TIFF coder now outputs colormapped images with 1, 2, 4, and 8
bits per sample in order to provide much smaller file sizes for
images with very few colors.</li>
<li>Many TIFF coder enhancements. Now reads colormapped and grayscale
images at arbitrary (even odd) bits-per-sample sizes. Now properly
supports an opacity channel (at any bits-per-sample value) for
grayscale images. Bilevel grayscale images are treated similar to any
other grayscale image unless CCITT FAX3/FAX4 compression is
requested. Now allows the user to specify an arbitrary
bits-per-sample value for grayscale images (even odd values) using
&quot;-define tiff:bits-per-sample=value&quot;. Now automatically stores the
image as TrueColor RGB pixels if the image compression is set to JPEG.
TIFF files are now written in using the TIFF library's default endian
order rather than always big endian.</li>
<li>The WPG coder now renders embedded WMFs.</li>
<li>The PS3 coder is completely re-written to work much better and
support more features (see ChangeLog).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Code structure enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Error handling has been improved and validated through testing.
Some errors were being lost, unnecessarily ignored, or reported as
something else entirely.</li>
<li>The number of error text messages to be maintained has been reduced
by consolidating similar messages.</li>
<li>The memory allocator functions have been replaced with similar
macros in order to eliminate warnings with GCC 3.3, avoid
accidentally casting away const, and allow memory debuggers to
report memory allocations and frees against the correct functions.
The previously-used functions remain in the library for the purpose
of compatibility.</li>
<li>&lt;magick/xwindow.h&gt; no longer depends on magick_config.h defines.</li>
<li>The text string localization code has been replaced with a simpler
version written by Bill Radcliffe.</li>
<li>Added key,value &quot;map&quot; APIs (somewhat similar to C++'s &lt;map&gt;) for
internal use.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>API enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Incorporated John Cristy's Wand API's in a new GraphicsMagickWand
library.</li>
<li>API definition is no longer dependent on types which vary in size
(e.g. size_t) depending on large file compilation options.  This means
that applications may now be compiled without any special large file
options and still work properly with the library.</li>
<li>Thrown exceptions (ExceptionInfo structure) now include source
file, source line, function name, and current system error number.</li>
<li>The GetMagickInfoArray() function is added to replace use of
GetMagickInfo() for code which needs to access the coder list. This
is necessary since invoking GetMagickInfo() may re-order the coder
list, causing problems for code which traverses the list. Using
GetMagickInfo() to access individual list elements is safe.</li>
<li>Added the CopyException function to support copying exception info
from one structure to another.</li>
<li>Added the ReplaceImageInList function to replace an image in an
image list.</li>
<li>Added the DrawPeekGraphicContext function to access the current
DrawInfo structure in the drawing context stack. Use of this
function is not recommended since it voilates proper programming
practices. It is added to support the Wand API's.</li>
<li>GetImageDepth() now returns an integral value between 1 and
QuantumDepth and is no longer limited to the values 8, 16, and 32.</li>
<li>SetImageDepth() supports setting the image modulus depth to any
integral value between 1 and QuantumDepth. This effects the effective
numeric precision, not the storage depth, since the quantum storage
type is still a Quantum.</li>
<li>GetImageChannelDepth() supports retrieving the modulus depth for a
specified channel.</li>
<li>SetImageChannelDepth() supports setting the modulus depth for a
specified channel.</li>
<li>ProfileImage is updated to handle alpha channels and grayscale
images.</li>
<li>Added GetImageProfile() to retrieve a CMS profile from an image.</li>
<li>Added SetImageProfile() to attach a CMS profile to an image without
adjusting the image pixels.</li>
<li>Added DeleteImageProfile() to remove a CMS profile from an image.</li>
<li>ConstituteImage() and DispatchImage() now support 'T' (transparency),
'O' (opacity), and 'P' (pad) options.</li>
<li>CompositeImage() now supports CopyCyanCompositeOp,
CopyMagentaCompositeOp, CopyYellowCompositeOp, and
CopyBlackCompositeOp, composition operators.</li>
<li>GetColorHistogram() obtains a color histogram for the image.</li>
<li>QuantumOperatorImage() and QuantumOperatorRegionImage() support
arithmetic and bitwise operations on specified image channels.</li>
<li>The semaphore.h header is no longer installed or included in the
API headers since these functions are private interfaces.</li>
<li>Configure using --enable-symbol-prefix or define
PREFIX_MAGICK_SYMBOLS to use the C preprocessor to prefix all library
symbols with &quot;Gm&quot;. This prevents library symbol conflicts with other
libraries.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>PerlMagick fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Adjusted a number of function option names so that they match the
documentation.</li>
<li>Memory leak fixed.</li>
<li>Reading files (e.g. GIF) via a file descriptor is fixed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Build improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The TRIO library may be used to provide a replacement for vsnprintf
if the C library doesn't provide it.  This improves security on old
systems.</li>
<li>Configure only configures for C &amp; C++ languages.</li>
<li>Configure now does a better job of figuring out how to build a
thread-safe library across multiple operating systems.</li>
<li>Configure incorporates a new mmap() test which tests the
functionality which is needed so that mmap() is not unnecessarily
rejected on a number of systems. This improves performance for large
files on those systems.</li>
<li>Configure/build fixes for IBM's AIX operating system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows-specific improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The static install package now uses the &quot;uninstalled&quot;
configuration so that it does not depend on the Windows registry in
order to run. This allows files from the static install package to
be copied to another computer without running an installer.</li>
<li>The executable search path is extended at run-time to include the
directory where the CORE DLLs reside in order to ensure that they
are found.</li>
<li>Adding the -t option to VisualMagick configure enables building
all of the coders into one library in order to save build time and
simplify linkage.</li>
<li>The XTRN coder now supports wide characters.</li>
<li>LCMS library updated to version 1.10.</li>
<li>GMDisplay displays a checkerboard pattern behind transparent images.</li>
<li>Support is provided for issuing log messages to the Windows standard
logging system.</li>
<li>Project files are now provided for use with Borland C++ Builder 6.0.</li>
<li>Updated LCMS version to 1.12.</li>
<li>Updated FreeType version to 2.1.5.</li>
<li>Updated JBIG-KIT to version 1.5.</li>
<li>Updated libpng to version 1.2.5.</li>
<li>Updated libwmf to version 0.2.8.2.</li>
<li>Updates zlib to version 1.2.1.</li>
<li>ActivePerl 5.8.1 Build 807 now supported.</li>
<li>GraphicsMagick now compiles using Visual Studio .NET 2003.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>Many performance enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Default QuantumDepth is 8 since this is adequate for most purposes
and more efficient than 16.</li>
<li>The Magick++ demo (compiled with QuantumDepth=8 and -O2) runs about
1.8X faster under SPARC/Solaris than the same demo with ImageMagick
5.5.4.</li>
<li>Colorspace transformations are much faster.</li>

<li>PseudoClass image handling is faster.</li>
<li>Text annotations using FreeType are much faster.</li>
<li>Image file I/O is much faster.</li>
<li>RLE-compressed MIFF reading much faster.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Code structure enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All utility support functions moved to magick/command.c in order to
significantly reduce link dependencies, allowing statically-linked
programs to be smaller.</li>
<li>Use of MogrifyImage() eliminated except for by utilities.</li>
<li>Re-builds due to changes to &lt;magick/image.h&gt; reduced by splitting the
header into multiple headers.</li>
<li>ISO C '99 typedefs (gm_int16_t, gm_uint16_t, gm_int32_t, gm_uint32_t,
gm_int64_t, gm_uint64_t) are available for use.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Feature enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Module loader always enabled for shared builds to allow extension.</li>
<li>Loading of arbitrary filter modules (via -process option) supported
under Unix as well as Windows.</li>
<li>SVG coder allows specifying size and initial background color.</li>
<li>JPEG-2000 coder (JP2) updated to work with Jasper 1.7.</li>
<li>HWB and HSL image colorspace translation support.</li>
<li>JNG/MNG/PNG format support tracks ImageMagick version.</li>
<li>BMP encoder can write 16-color indexed BMPs now as well as 2-color
BMPs (not restricted to monochrome).</li>
<li>TIFF decoder now includes optimized support for tiled and stripped
TIFF.</li>
<li>The -random-threshold option (RandomThresholdImage()) is added to
threshold an image to bilevel using random thresholding.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Major bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>100% successful test completion at all quantum depths (8/16/32).</li>
<li>A temporary file management subsystem is added to ensure that all
temporary files are removed before program exit. Temporary files are
created and used in a secure fashion to avoid the possibility that a
&quot;trojan&quot; temporary file (e.g. a symbolic link, or a file containing
unsafe content) is created before a delegate has the chance to write
to it. The environment variable MAGICK_TMPDIR allows the user to
specify where temporary files are created without altering where
other programs create their temporary files. Temporary filenames are
created in 8+3 format to hopefully be more acceptable to ralcgm.</li>
<li>When dithering is disabled, don't dither when converting to a
PseudoClass, grayscale, or monochrome image. Disabling dithering
may cause these translations to be much faster.</li>
<li>PICON format works with BLOBs.</li>
<li>No longer removes input file when pinging a FlashPIX file.</li>
<li>Arc drawing and texture fill fixes from ImageMagick.</li>
<li>Sample, scale and affine fixes from ImageMagick.</li>
<li>MIFF colormaps are now scaled properly while reading.</li>
<li>CMYK translation works for QuantumDepth=32.</li>
<li>ConstituteImage now works properly for grayscale images.</li>
<li>Built-in tilde expansion and filename globbing now works properly.</li>
<li>InitializeMagick now registers signal handlers to ensure that
resources are released before program exit.  This helps avoid
temporary file leaks due to the user using &quot;CONTROL-C&quot;.</li>
<li>The installed &lt;magick/magick_config.h&gt; header now only contains
the few definitions required by the API headers.  This should
significantly reduce or eliminate conflicts with other package
headers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows platform enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Configure updated for Visual C++ 7.0.</li>
<li>OLE object (ImageMagickObject) re-written to work with Visual C++ 7.0</li>
<li>New function, CropImageToHBITMAP(), to return a region of the image
as a Windows HBITMAP.</li>
<li>Use vsnprintf to format strings under Windows (safer).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>On November 19, 2002, GraphicsMagick was created as a fork of
ImageMagick, several days before the ImageMagick 5.5.2 release.</p>
<p>The objectives of GraphicsMagick are to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use an open development model.</li>
<li>Encourage new developers to join the project.</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary source code &quot;churn&quot;.</li>
<li>Establish and preserve a stable API.</li>
<li>Use efficient coding practices which result in fast code.</li>
<li>Improve memory efficiency.</li>
<li>Use a release process which assures a working product.</li>
<li>Maintain an accurate ChangeLog.</li>
